TaggedEnd TaggedPClinic or ofﬁce BP measurement is one of the most com- mon procedures in medical practice. In most settings world-wide, estimation of a patient’s usual level of BP is based on clinic measurements, often as the only method available. Thus, while recognizing the importance of out-of-clinic BPmeasurements, the focus of this report is on BP measured inclinic settings. Measuring BP following a standardizedapproach and using clinically validated devices are impor-tant because these methods have been employed in researchto establish BP thresholds associated with cardiovasculardisease risk, to determine the beneﬁts of lowering BP on health outcomes, and to establish optimal BP treatment tar- gets. Although not a focus here, these principles of stan-dardization are directly applicable to the measurement ofBP at home. The lack of standardization in BP measure-ment is a serious and frequent problem in contemporaryclinical practice that impacts patient safety and health sys-tem performance. 8TaggedEnd TaggedPFor several decades, clinical practice guidelines9-17and position statements18-22have provided detailed instruc- tions on clinic BP measuremen t. Despite these efforts, standardization is not implem ented in most clinical practi- ces18because its importance is often underappreciated, and the necessary steps are considered time-consumingand impractical. 23However, reliable, accurate BP meas- urements are essential to best manage hypertension. Weposit that it is feasible to streamline the clinic workﬂow and adopt other strategies that minimize the amount of time required to perform standardized BP measurements.An important recommendation among these strategies isto discriminate between various types of clinic visitsdepending on whether or not BP management is an objec-tive during the visit. In this paradigm, standardized BPwould be routinely obtained during clinic visits where thescreening, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension are objectives. TaggedEnd TaggedPThis document represents a consensus statement by the authors, all of whom represent the position of one or moreprofessional health organizations and other health partners.It is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of theliterature or a summary of other detailed guidelines, nor isit intended to reconcile differences across guidelines.Instead, we aim to balance the rigor of BP measurement techniques used in all hypertension outcome trials with the pragmatism that is required in daily clinical practice. Ourreport is based on a careful examination of the proceduresrecommended in clinical practice guidelines and a compila-tion of the most essential elements that are supported byconsensus among the authors of this document. Recommen-dations of individual details in this document are not gradedby their strength of evidence, but standardized BP measure- ment itself is our strong recommendation. The readers are referred to published guidelines and scientiﬁc statementsfor other elements of BP measurement ( Appendix 1 , avail- able online). Our presumption is that a simpliﬁedstandardized BP measurement protocol will lead to its wide adoption in daily practice, with minimal compromise inmeasurement accuracy and reliability. TaggedEnd TaggedPIn addition to making a strong recommendation to adopt the streamlined protocol described herein, we provide the rationale for standardization, discuss barriers to its imple- mentation, and propose strategies to overcome these bar-riers. The ultimate goal of this joint statement is to ensurethat health care organizations, health care professionals andpatients can have greater conﬁdence that the BP measure-ments used to guide management will improve clinical out-comes. TaggedEnd TAGGEDH1WHAT IS STANDARDIZED CLINIC BP MEASUREMENT? TAGGEDEND TaggedPIn this document, standardized clinic BP measurement refers to readings obtained following procedures outlined ina protocol that includes steps recommended by most prac-tice guidelines ( Figure ). It necessitates preparation of the patient as well as speciﬁcations of the setting, equipment, measurement procedure, and the way in which the BP read-ings are recorded. Further explanations and certain detailsof the recommendations are provided in the text at the endof this section. TaggedEnd TaggedPAdditional comments on the steps of implementation in theFigure . TaggedEnd TaggedH2Facility and Equipment TaggedEnd TaggedP TaggedEndTaggedP(a) An automated upper-arm cuff monitor is strongly rec- ommended for several reasons. TaggedEndTaggedPi. It eliminates human error associated with manual devices (eg, those due to hearing impairment anddigit preference) and requires less training. TaggedEnd TaggedPii. It minimizes interactions between the patient and health care professionals and, therefore, distrac-tions during the preparatory and BP measurement phases. TaggedEnd TaggedPiii. It allows the health care professionals to perform other tasks during the measurements. TaggedEnd TaggedPiv. Upper-arm (brachial) BP measurements have been used in many large, randomized, controlled outcomehypertension trials. TaggedEnd TaggedP(b) Properly validated automated BP monitors with upper- arm cuff are listed in Table 1. The authors do notendorse any speciﬁc brand or model. TaggedEnd TaggedP(c) Details of facility and equipment requirements can be found in published practice guidelines and position statements ( Appendix 1 , available online). TaggedEnd TaggedP(d) Electronic monitors for children, pregnant women, and individuals with a large arm circumference ( >42 cm) should be validated in dedicated clinical studies thataddress these speciﬁc populations. The reader isreferred to the manufacturer’s instructions and relevantliterature for detailed information for these popula-tions. TaggedEndTaggedEndCheung et al International Consensus on Standardized Clinic Blood Pressure Measurement 439 TaggedH2Personnel Performing BP Measurement TaggedEnd TaggedP TaggedEndTaggedP(a) Patient preparation and BP measurement should be performed by medical staff or health care professionals who are trained in these procedures. Retraining on a routine basis (eg, annually) is helpful to ensureproﬁciency. 24TaggedEnd TaggedP(b) Systematic certiﬁcation and regular recertiﬁcation will promote proper training and retraining of proper BPmeasurement. TaggedEnd TaggedP(c) Details on descriptions of qualiﬁcations, training. and certiﬁcations of personnel performing BP meas- urements can be found in pu blished practice guide- lines and position statements ( Appendix 1 , available online). TaggedEnd TaggedH2Prepare the Patient TaggedEndTaggedP TaggedEndTaggedP(a) Proper preparation by and of the patient is essential regardless of the equipment used. TaggedEnd TaggedP(b) There should be a rest period of 3-5 minutes prior to the BP measurement to minimize stressors that mayincrease BP. However, clinical judgment should beexercised on the individual circumstance to determinewhether this duration of rest is sufﬁcient to achieve the goal. TaggedEnd TaggedP(c) If the patient has not been adequately prepared (eg, the patient has ingested caffeine immediately prior to the clinic visit), repeat BP measurements at a later timeduring the visit should be considered. TaggedEnd TaggedH2Measurement Procedure TaggedEndTaggedP TaggedEndTaggedP(a) There is unanimous agreement among the work group members that BP should be measured at least 2 times and the readings should be averaged, without specify-ing whether any reading should be discarded. Auto-mated averaging is performed by several BP monitors. TaggedEnd TaggedP(b) There is no consensus on the importance of whether BP measurements should be conducted in the absence of ahealth care professional in the room, a conditionreferred to as unattended ofﬁce BP. Some automated monitors allow repeat measurements to be made unat- tended, which has the advantage of minimizing distrac-tion prior to and during the measurements.

TaggedEnd TaggedP(d) Details on the BP measurement procedure can be found in published guidelines and position statements(Appendix 1 , available online). TaggedEnd TAGGEDH1RATIONALE FOR STANDARDIZED CLINIC BP MEASUREMENT TAGGEDEND TaggedPAlmost all of the cohort studies that estimated BP-related cardiovascular disease risks and the randomized controlledtrials that underpin the recommendations for antihyperten-sive treatment and BP treatment goals for adults with high BP have employed standardized BP measurements in the clinic. Hence, guideline committees and professional socie-ties have repeatedly emphasized the importance of stan-dardized clinic BP measurements that aim to minimizesystematic and random errors in estimation. The practice ofevidence-based medicine and the likelihood of achievingoutcome results similar to those shown in randomized con-trolled trials require adherence to these recommendations. TaggedEnd TaggedPStandardization is essential because there are many aspects of BP measurement, including the patient’s physicalcondition, clinic environment, and equipment that can read-ily result in inaccurate and unreliable values. 23,25,26A sys- tematic review of 328 articles found 29 components of theBP measurement procedure that can affect systolic BP(SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels. 27Clinic BP measure- ments that do not follow a standardized protocol are likely to result in inaccurate and highly variable readings from one clinic visit to the next, making targeting a speciﬁed BPgoal very challenging. TaggedEndTaggedPUsually, BP readings obtained in nonstandardized prac- tice in the clinic are higher than those obtained by standard-ized measurements. 15,26,28-30Therefore, the use of nonstandardized clinic BP measurements tend to result in overtreatment. In contrast, for some people, routine clinic BP readings are lower than those obtained following a stan-dardized protocol, 29,30resulting in a missed opportunity to detect high BP or the need to intensify antihypertensivetreatment. Further, the variability of nonstandardized BP atthe individual patient level is very large. Hence, there is noalgorithm that can reliably convert BP values measured in anonstandardized fashion to standardized measurement equivalents for patient management. TaggedEnd TaggedPThe lack of standardized BP measurement also makes it difﬁcult to accurately determine the prevalence of under-treatment or overtreatment of BP from a population-healthstandpoint. It has been estimated that approximately 1 in 5US adults could have their hypertension diagnosis or con-trol status misclassiﬁed if BP were measured in a nonstan-dardized manner. 27TaggedEnd TAGGEDH1ROLE OF HOME BP MONITORING AND AMBULATORY BP MONITORING TAGGEDEND TaggedPMany guidelines advocate greater use of out-of-clinic BP measurement (ie, home BP monitoring [HBPM] or ambula- tory BP monitoring [ABPM]) to conﬁrm the diagnosis of hypertension and guide BP management.10,11,15,17The advantages, limitations, and applications of ABPM andHBPM have been detailed by many guidelines and positionstatements, 10,17,22,31including the ability to detect white- coat and masked hypertension. However, no large random-ized controlled outcome trial addressing BP targets or anti-hypertensive drugs has used ABPM or HBPM to guide management. As such, the evidence base to support BP tar- gets using ABPM or HBPM is uncertain and their role atpresent should be considered complementary toTaggedEndTable 1 Organizations Providing Online Lists of Validated BP Monitors Organization Monitor lists (language) Scientiﬁc association Website STRIDE BP International (English, Chinese, Spanish)European Society of Hypertension - International Society of Hyperten- sion - World Hypertension Leaguewww.stridebp.org BIHS UK, Ireland (English) British and Irish Hypertension Societywww.bihsoc.org/bp-monitors VDL US (English) American Medical Association www.validatebp.org Hypertension Canada Canada (English) Hypertension Canada www.hypertension.ca/bpdevices Deutsche Hochdruckliga Germany (German) German High Pressure League www.hochdruckliga.de/betroffene/ blutdruckmessgeraete-mit- pruefsiegel JSH Japan (Japanese) Japanese Society of Hypertension www.jpnsh.jp/com_ac_wg1.html BP = blood pressure; STRIDE BP = Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe Blood Pressure; VDL = validated device listing.

However, studies have also shown that addressing these barriers can dramatically improve thequality of clinic BP measurements. 32-36 TaggedEndTaggedP1.Appreciation of importance of standardized BP mea- surement by health care workers. Many health care workers are unaware of the large degree of variabilityof nonstandardized BP measurement and its implica-tions for patient safety. TaggedEnd TaggedP2.Patient knowledge . Patients are usually unaware of the importance and procedures of standardized BP meas- urements as well as the clinical consequences of poor- quality BP measurements. TaggedEnd TaggedP3.Equipment . In some world regions, a stable source of electricity for automated BP monitors is not available.The limited availability of cuffs with various sizes isanother common barrier. TaggedEnd TaggedP4.Staff training . Many health professionals are inade- quately trained, and many clinics lack training and cer- tiﬁcation schedules and procedures, including curricula. TaggedEnd TaggedP5.Environment and workﬂow . A major challenge can be the clinic space, environment, and time constraints.During the BP measurement procedure, health carestaff are often taking other vital signs or medical his-tory or are performing other tasks in the room. Triageis often performed in busy and noisy spaces where rest- ing prior to BP measurements is difﬁcult. Examination rooms (eg, with wall-mounted aneroid devices) lackappropriate conﬁguration for proper BP measurement.Often, insufﬁcient time is built into the visit schedulefor proper patient preparation and BP measurements. TaggedEnd TaggedP6.Regulatory and system oversight of quality standards . Although many aspects of clinical practice are sub-jected to quality assessment and mandatory training, BP measurement does not fall into this category. In fact, the measurement procedure is even much less reg-ulated than the manufacturing of BP monitors. TaggedEnd TAGGEDH1SOLUTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS AND SUCCESS STORIES TAGGEDEND TaggedH2Be Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic TaggedEnd TaggedPMany clinics have workﬂow constraints, with BP measure- ment being only one of many tasks assigned to members ofthe health care team. Thus, the standardized BP measure- ment procedure must be pragmatic, time-efﬁcient, patient- and staff-friendly, and focused on essential aspects of themeasurement process ( Figure ) that contribute to large errorsand avoid being dogmatic regarding elements in which both supporting evidence and theoretical basis are not rigorous. TaggedEnd TaggedH2Roles of Patients and Clinic Personnel TaggedEnd TaggedPA concerted effort by patients, health care professionals, health care institutions, government, and other payers, andprofessional societies can overcome barriers to wide adop- tion of standardized clinic BP measurements ( Table 2 ). Well-informed patients will expect and demand high-qual-ity, standardized BP measurements, and automatedreminder messages advise the patients to make proper prep-arations in advance. TaggedEnd TaggedPClinic personnel should be trained and preferably certi- ﬁed in standardized BP measurement and receive regularlyscheduled refresher training and undergo annual recertiﬁca- tion. A number of training videos are available online (https://www.whleague.org/w hl-resources/awareness-and- screening/new-online- bp-certiﬁcation-course ;https://tar getbp.org/blood-pressure-improvement-program/control-bp/measure-accurately/accurate-bp-measurement-matters/ ). Organizations such as the World Hypertension League andSTRIDE BP ( https://www.stridebp.org/training ) offer brief online BP measurement traini ng and certiﬁcation geared toward health workers from all countries. 37Brief health worker trainings have been shown to be effective. Forexample, after receiving instructions in a brief curriculumin standardized hypertension screening and management,33 health care professionals stafﬁng 18 primary care clinicsin Tanzania substantially improved BP measurementknowledge and BP measurement techniques. 38Countries where physicians currently execute all tasks related to BP measurement and management may be ill-equipped to sup- port the implementation of standardized BP measure- ments;39these countries may need to adopt team-based approaches that include non-physician personnel. TaggedEnd TaggedH2Roles of Institutions and Governments TaggedEnd TaggedPHealth care institutions can prioritize standardized BP mea- surement by providing clinically validated BP monitors, ade-quate space, adequate stafﬁng, efﬁcient clinic workﬂowplans, regularly scheduled training of personnel, quality- improvement practices, and incentive programs based on objective benchmarks. Governments and payers can promotestandardization by requiring or incentivizing its practice, inaddition to dissemination of patient education materials, pro-viding data sharing, and using value-based instead of fee-for-service payment models. Positive and negative ﬁnancial andnonﬁnancial incentives provided by government regulatoryagencies, health care funding agencies and health care institu- tions are often effective in modifying medical practice, for example, by disseminating edu cational materials via lectures and postings on their websites. TaggedEndTaggedEnd442 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 136, No 5, May 2023 TaggedH2Standardized BP Measurements in Clinics Are Feasible TaggedEnd TaggedPSeveral examples support the p remise that implementing stan- dardized BP measurement is feasible in primary health caresettings, admittedly mostly in high-income countries. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Million Hearts Hypertension Control Champions and the American MedicalAssociation/American Heart A ssociation’s TargetBP recogni- tion programs both promote higher national standards for BPmeasurement through health care institution best-practicefacilitation, training, and certiﬁcation. 40,41One cornerstone of the successful Kaiser Permanente Hypertension program wasthe unfettered availability of automated BP monitors. 35This approach has also been successfully replicated in San Fran- cisco Health Network safety-net clinics, which provide careto predominantly minoritized and low-income patients. 34 The amount of time required to perform standardized BPmeasurement is minimal if the clinic workﬂow is streamlinedwith an automated BP monitor. 33The “Measure accurately, Act rapidly and Partner with patients” (MAP) protocol useda practice facilitation model to transition 16 South Carolina primary care clinics and more than16,000 patients from usual care BP measurement practices to standardized BPmeasurement. 42Transition to higher BP measurement stand- ards was successful and, in fact, favored by participatinghealth care workers. 42TaggedEnd TaggedPLow- and middle-resource health care systems may struggle to implement standardized clinic BP measurements due to scarcity of BP monitors, optimal clinic environment, personnel training, and other barriers. HEARTS in theAmericas, the adaptation of WHO Global HEARTS initia-tive, promote and implement strategic approaches toimprove the BP accuracy, including a simple and standard-ized measurement protocol and clinically validated BPdevices ( https://www.paho.org/en/hearts-americas/hearts- americas-blood-pressure-measurement ). 43TaggedEnd TaggedH2Be Proactive and Persistent TaggedEnd TaggedPDespite the clear rationale and necessity for standardized BP measurement, any change to clinic workﬂow, particu-larly when it involves multiple stakeholders such aspatients, health care providers, institutions, and administra-tors, is likely to be met with resistance. Early and periodic active engagement of these parties to set common goals and execute the plans will be necessary.
