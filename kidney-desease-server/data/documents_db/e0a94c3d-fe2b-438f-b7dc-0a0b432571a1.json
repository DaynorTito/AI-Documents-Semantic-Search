We evaluated the predictors of renal insuf ﬁciency and subsequent renal function recovery following PN. Data on 393 patients who underwent PN for solid renal tumors between March 2001 and November 2013, obtained from 6 institutions, wereretrospectively reviewed. Renal insuf ﬁciency was de ﬁned as new onset of chronic kidney disease stage ≥3 postoperatively on the second of 2 consecutive tests. Renal function recovery was de ﬁned as an estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate ≥60ml/minute/1.73 m 2 following renal insuf ﬁciency. Tumor complexity was strati ﬁed according to the RENAL classi ﬁcation system. The median (interquartile range) age, tumor size, and follow-up period were 53 (45 –63) years, 2.6 (1.9 –3.8) cm, and 36 (12 –48) months, respectively. Tumors were of low complexity in 258/393 (65.6%) of cases. Renal insuf ﬁciency developed in 54/393 (13.5%) patients, in which age ≥60 years and preoperative creatinine ≥1.1mg/ml were independent predictors. Tumor complexity, clamp type, and operative method were not signi ﬁcant prognostic factors. Among patients with newly developed renal insuf ﬁciency, 18/54 (33.3%) patients exhibited renal function recovery within a median period of 18 months, of which preoperative creatinine <1.1mg/ml was an independent predictor. Age ≥60 years and preoperative creatinine ≥1.1mg/ml were risk factors for renal insuf ﬁciency following PN. Patients with renal insuf ﬁciency whose preoperative creatinine was <1.1mg/ml were likely to have renal function recovery.

Introduction The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend partial nephrectomy (PN) as the treatment of choice for cT1 tumors.[1]PN was originally indicated if radical nephrectomy would render the patient functionally anephric,necessitating dialysis, such as for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a solitary kidney, RCC in 1 kidney with inadequate contralateral renal function, or bilateral synchronous RCC. There isaccumulating evidence that the oncologic outcomes of PN are comparable to those of radical nephrectomy. [2,3]Moreover, PN allows preservation of renal function, decrease in overallmortality, and reduced risk of cardiovascular events. [4,5]Hence, over the past decade, PN has become the standard of care for most technically resectable renal tumors.[6]In Korea, the proportion of PN performed has rapidly increased from 2008to 2014. [7] As a surrogate for the success of the PN, the trifecta outcome was investigated, which represents no complications, negativesurgical margins, and warm ischemia time (WIT) <25 minutes. [8]In addition to the trifecta outcome, long-term renal function was another parameter used to prove the success of PNas one of the pentafecta outcomes. [9]Several factors, including WIT, loss of parenchymal volume, and ischemic damage in preserved tissue during the operation, are known renal functionrisk factors after PN. These factors are closely related to variousEditor: Giuseppe Lucarelli.

However, published data from a multicenterdatabase of patients with an initial diagnosis of RCC after PN is scarce. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported predictors of renal function recovery following renalinsuf ﬁciency in patients who underwent PN. The aims of this multicenter analysis were to predict renal insuf ﬁciency and to identify the prognostic factors of subsequent renal functionrecovery following PN. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study population and data collection A total of 393 consecutive Korean patients with RCC treated with PN were selected from the multi-center, SeveranceUrological Oncology Group PN registry. Data on patients who underwent PN for RCC between March 2001 and November 2013, obtained from 6 institutions, were retrospec-tively reviewed. The present study ’s retrospective protocol was reviewed and approved by the Yonsei University Health System Ethics Committee, which waived the requirement for informedconsent (2019-005-001). The patient records were anonymizedand de-identi ﬁed prior to analysis. Patient demographics, including age, sex, body mass index, and a history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, were collected. Perioperativeand postoperative outcomes were assessed, including American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor size, RENAL nephr- ometry score, intraoperative surgical complications, operativetime, clamp type, ischemic time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and serum chemistry. Preoperative radiological examination data (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of the enrolled patients were inter preted by radiologists in the urology department at each participating hospital. The ﬁnal pathology was determined using surgical specimens andreported by the uropathologists at each institution. Pathologi- cal data included pathological tumor size, TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, positive surgical margin (PSM), and histologi-cal subtype. Tumor complexity was strati ﬁed according to the RENAL classi ﬁcation system [10]: low (RENAL nephrometry score /C207) or high (RENAL nephrometry score ≥8). Postoperative complications ( /C2030 days after surgery) were graded according to the modi ﬁed Clavien-Dindo classi ﬁcation.[11]Trifecta achievement was de ﬁned as a WIT of <25minutes, negative surgical margins, and no complications intraoperatively or postoperatively (Clavien-Dindo complication grade ≥3) as a surrogate of surgical quality. The estimated glomerularﬁltration rate (eGFR) was determined using the Modi ﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease formula. [12]Renal insuf ﬁciency was deﬁned as a new onset eGFR <60ml/minute/1.73m2(chronic kidney disease stage ≥3) postoperatively on the second of 2 consecutive tests at least 3 months apart. Renal function recovery was de ﬁned as eGFR ≥60ml/minute/1.73m2follow- ing renal insuf ﬁciency. Patients without notable complications were followed up with serum chemistries every 3 months for 2 years. Thereafter,the decision of follow up protocols after surgical treatment wasbased on the surgeons ’discretion. All patients received standard care according to contemporary guidelines for the duration of follow-up.2.2. Study endpoints The endpoint was the predictors associated with renal insuf ﬁ- ciency and subsequent renal function recovery. 2.3. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were evaluated by the Fisher exact test. Differences in variables with a continuous distribution across categories were assessed using the Mann –Whitney Utest. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed onpredictors of renal insuf ﬁciency and subsequent renal function recovery that had a Pvalue<.05 in the univariate analyses. The signed-rank test for each group was used to compare medianserum creatinine and eGFR at different time points. All reported Pvalues are two-sided, and statistical signi ﬁcance was set at P< .05. Statistical analyses were performed using the StatisticalPackage for Social Sciences, version 23.0, for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 3. Results The baseline clinical and demogr aphic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The median (interquartile range)age, tumor size, and follow-up period were 53 (45 –63) years, 2.6 (1.9 –3.8) cm, and 36 (12 –48) months, respectively. Tumors of low complexity were found in 258/393 (65.6%) cases.Clavien-Dindo complication grade ≥3 occurred in 5.1% (20/ 393) of patients. The main reasons for Clavien-Dindo complication grade ≥3 were hemorrhage (8/20, 40%) followed by pseudoaneurysm (5/20, 25%). Radical nephrectomy conversion occurred in 2/20 (0.5%) cases. The median ischemic time was 25.0 (18.0 –31.0) minutes, and there were no differences according to tumor complexity. The achievementrates of trifecta and pentafecta were 43.8% and 37.9%, respectively. Patients with high complexity had a larger tumor size (P=.002) and higher Fuhrman grade ( ≥3) (P=.011) than those with low complexity. Tumor complexity was signi ﬁcantly associated with complications ( P=.005), ischemic time ( P =.005), and PSM ( P=.014), but not with postoperative renal insuf ﬁciency ( P=.943). The achievement rate of trifecta for high and low complexities was 31.1% and 50.4%, respectively(P<.001), and the achievement rate of pentafecta was 28.1%, 43.0%, respectively ( P=.004). There were no differences in operative time, type of pedicle clamp, EBL, proportion of renalinsuf ﬁciency, or follow-up period between the groups according to renal complexity. Table 2 shows the change in median eGFR over time according to clamping type, RENAL nephrometry score, and WIT.Decreased eGFR at 3 months postoperatively ﬁnally recovered to near preoperative levels at 2 years ( P=.865). Although the eGFR level at 2 years recovered to the preoperative levelregardless of clamping method, the patterns of the change in eGFR varied. The patients with WIT ≥25minutes had no recovery of renal function at 2 years compared to preoperativelevels. Renal insuf ﬁciency developed in 54/393 (13.7%) patients, in which age ≥60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 3.04; con ﬁdence interval [CI], 1.681 –5.512; P<.001) and preoperative creatinine ≥1.1mg/ml (HR, 3.57; 95% CI, 2.050 –6.202; P<.001) were independent predictors (Table 3).Lee et al. Medicine (2019) 98:18 Medicine 2 Among these patients, 18/54 (33.3%) patients exhibited renal function recovery within a median (interquartile range) period of 18 (12 –36) months, of which preoperative creatinine <1.1mg/ml was an independent predictor (HR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.203 –15.911; P=.025) (Table 4).4. Discussion The increasing use of abdominal imaging including ultrasonog- raphy, CT, and MRI is the main cause for the increasing detectionrate of renal masses.

Medicine (2019) 98:18 www.md-journal.com 3 paramount treatment option for patients with small renal masses. A satisfactory oncologic outcome is the cardinal goal of allsurgical methods. Trifecta and pentafecta have been proposed as measurement tools for the outcomes of PN. Recently published data reported that trifecta outcomes ranged from 31% to78%. [8,9,14,15]Because of the lack of a de ﬁnition of trifecta for PN cases and variations in surgical approach and technique, PN studies using trifecta showed heterogeneous outcomes. We usedcomplications (Clavien-Dindo complication grade ≥3), PSMs, and WIT ≥25minsute to evaluate the trifecta achievement rate. Our achievement rate of trifecta was 43.8%, and this rate is atleast partially similar to the results of previous studies. Moreover, concerns regarding preservation of renal function emerged with the increasing demand for PN. Postoperative renal function after PN is affected by various factors, includingdecreasing WIT to reduce the ischemic injury, loss of normal parenchymal volume to prevent positive surgical margins, and ischemic damage in preserved tissue during the operation. [16,17]The optimal threshold of WIT to prevent renal function deterioration remains controversial. In the trifecta standard, WIT<25minutes was used, but recent papers proposed the optimal threshold of WIT to be within 20 minutes. [18,19]Moreover, Thompson et al found that in patients with a solitary kidney,every minute of clamping has short- and long-term renal consequences. [20]In this study, when analyzing WIT at each minute from 20 to 30 minutes, no signi ﬁcant cutoff point was found. However, WIT ≥25minutes was a factor associated with prolonged recovery or no recovery of the preoperative eGFR. Postoperative renal function was related to loss of normal parenchymal volume and ischemic damage in preservedtissue. [21,22]Mir MC et al reported that renal function ultimately was primarily associated with parenchymal volume preservation, whereas ischemia played a role in the level of renal functionpresent 4 to 12 months after PN. [22]However, our multicenter analysis based on long-term follow-up demonstrated that the type of ischemia was not related to renal function. The results ofthis study are expected to be interpreted as a result of compensatory growth in the contralateral kidney and a more reﬁned assessment of the effect of ischemia. The role of various factors in ﬂuencing the recovery of renal function after PN have been investigated, including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, male sex, old age, smoking,BMI ≥30kg/m 2, vascular disease, use of anti-thrombolytic medication, remnant renal volume, and surgical methods and type.[23]However, in our study, only the factor associated with preoperative renal function, creatinine <1.1mg/ml, was found to affect renal function recovery. The RENAL nephrometry score re ﬂects the anatomic and surgical complexity. Several studies investigated the RENALnephrometry score as a tool to predict factors associated with increased operative time, EBL, total renal volume loss, WIT, and complications. [24,25]In the present study, as expected, WIT, complication rate, and positive surgical margins statisticallyincreased with increasing RENAL nephrometry score. However, no study has predicted long term-renal function using the RENAL nephrometry score. Recently, Husain et al reported thathealthy renal volume loss or non-neoplastic parenchymal volume was associated with RENAL nephrometry score.

Medicine (2019) 98:18 Medicine 4 MN reported that the RENAL nephrometry score was associated with changes in the percent of functional volume preservationand the perioperative functional decrease in an analysis of 237 patients who underwent PN from 2007 to 2010. [24]We found that the eGFR at 2 years after PN, regardless of complexity, wasnot inferior to the preoperative eGFR. To our knowledge, this is theﬁrst study to show that the RENAL nephrometry score is not a prognostic factor predicting renal insuf ﬁciency and renal function recovery. This study has several limitations in addition to its retrospec- tive design. Heterogeneity of intraoperative management existed.Patient selection, multiple surgical methods, and techniquesinﬂuenced by the physician ’s preference could account for the heterogeneity in our results. We do not have data on the number of cases that underwent radical nephrectomy because PN was notrecommended for small renal mass. In addition, measurement of the RENAL nephrometry score and pathologic results were not centrally investigated but were assessed by urologists andpathologists at each institution. Nevertheless, we believe that this effect may re ﬂect real-world clinical practice and is inherent in any retrospective study. Finally, we evaluated the parametersto predict renal function recovery; however, previous studies have investigated renal functional compensation as a phenome- non of renal compensatory adaptation. [21,22]In the future, we plan to evaluate the contribution of ipsilateral atrophy orcontralateral hypertrophy to renal functional recovery after partial nephrectomy. 5. Conclusion Age≥60 years and preoperative creatinine ≥1.1mg/ml were risk factors for renal insuf ﬁciency following PN. Patients with renal insuf ﬁciency whose preoperative creatinine was <1.1mg/ml were more likely to have renal function recovery. Author contributions Conceptualization: Kyo Chul Koo.
