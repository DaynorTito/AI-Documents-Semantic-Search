  "content": "INTRODUCTION There have been many efforts for the early detection and management of diabetic nephropathy, which is the leadingcause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (1, 2). Microalbumin-uria is the initial clinical evidence and an increased albuminexcretion rate (AER) is one of the most conventional param-eters for the progression of diabetic nephropathy (3, 4). Mea-suring AER as a marker of diabetic nephropathy is based onthe natural history of nephropathy in type 1 diabetes (5-10).However, in type 2 diabetes, there are many other factors thatcan contribute to renal insufficiency without causing albu-minuria, such as atherosclerosis in renal vasculature, choles-terol emboli, and interstitial fibrosis (11, 12). It has been reported that a decline in the renal function of patients with diabetes is not always accompanied by an in-creased AER (13, 14). About 20-30% of type 2 diabeticswith renal insufficiency showed normoalbuminuria (12-18).In the Third National Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey, the prevalence of patients with type 2 diabetes andrenal insufficiency in the absence of both albuminuria andretinopathy was about 30% (12). Compared with the renal insufficiency with albuminuria, the patients with normoal-buminuric renal insufficiency were characterized by femalepredominance, older age, higher HDL cholesterol, lower preva-lence of r etinopathy, and possibly better prognosis (15-17). In addition, compared with diabetic patients with normoal-buminuria and normal renal function, patients with normoal- buminuric r enal insufficiency had an increased risk of cardio- vascular disease and metabolic syndrome (18-20). Therefore,normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency is a distinct entity indiabetic renal complications. However, the natural course andpathophysiologic mechanism of normoalbuminuric renal insuf-ficiency are still elusive. It has been shown that ESRD accounts for 10-30% of the deaths in Asian diabetic patients, which clearly contrasts witha <5-10% risk of renal death in Caucasian diabetic patients(21). Furthermore, a 4-yr follow up study showed that Asiandiabetic patients are at high risk of progression to ESRD com-pared with Caucasian diabetic patients (22). These data sug-gest that Asian patients are more susceptible to diabetic renal disease compared with Caucasians.

As little is known about normoalbuminuricrenal insufficiency in the Asian population, we examined its prevalence and clinicalcharacteristics in Korean type 2 diabetic patients. We studied 562 patients with type2 diabetes from Seoul National University Hospital. The estimated glomerular filtra-tion rate (eGFR) was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formu-la and the degree of albuminuria was evaluated by spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio.Of 562 patients, 151 (26.9%) patients had renal insufficiency (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m 2). Among them, 44 (29.1%) patients had normoalbuminuria. After excluding the patients using renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, the prevalence of nor-moalbuminuric renal insufficiency was 35.3% (18 of 51 patients). Compared with micro- and macroalbuminuric renal insufficiency, normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency wasassociated with the female predominance, shorter duration of diabetes, lower preva-lence of diabetic retinopathy, and lower prevalence of using antihypertensive drugsexcept RAS inhibitors. The prevalence decreased progressively w ith an increase in the duration of diabetes and an increase in the severity of retinopathy. Normoalbumin- uric renal insufficiency was prevalent in Korean type 2 diabetic patients. The asso- ciation with a shorter duration of the diabetes and a lower prevalence of retinopathysuggests that it might be an early stage renal complication. Key Words : Normoalbuminuria; Renal Insufficiency; Diabetes Mellitus; Type 2Received : 15 July 2008 Accepted : 24 December 2008 cal characteristics of normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency in Asian diabetic patients might be different from their Cau-casian counterparts. We therefore performed a study on the prevalence and clin- icalcharacteristics of Korean type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency and examined its rela-tions to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, diabeticretinopathy, and the duration of the diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population We studied 562 randomly selected patients from the Dia- betes Clinic at Seoul National University Hospital from Jan-uary to December, 2006, who were diagnosed with type 2diabetes. Excluded from this study were those patients withanti-GAD antibodies; those who started insulin therapy with-in the first year after diagnosis; those with a urinary tract infec-tion, hematuria, or other causes of renal insufficiency; those with cardiac or hepatic failure; and those with a severe inter-current illness, including malignancy. The Institutional Review Board of the Clinical Research Institute in Seoul NationalUniversity Hospital approved the study protocol. Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) We calculated the GFR with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula (23) and defined renalinsufficiency as an estimated GFR (eGFR) of less than 60mL/min per 1.73 m 2body surface area (BSA), which corre- sponded to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline (24). Quantification of albuminuria We measured the degree of albuminuria with spot tests of the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Urinary albu-min levels were measured by turbitimer assay (A&T 502X,A&T, Tokyo, Japan) and urine creatinine levels were mea-sured by the Jaffe method (Hitachi 7170, Hitachi, Tokyo,Japan). We used sex-specific ACR cut points to define micro- and macroalbuminuria (25, 26). Microalbuminuria was definedas an ACR from 17 to 250 μg/mg for males and from 25 to 355 μg/mg for females. Macroalbuminuria was defined as an ACR over 250 μg/mg and over 355 μg/mg for males and females, respectively. Albuminuria denotes the presence ofmicro- or macroalbuminuria. Assessment of covariates Questionnaires and review of the patients’ medical recordswere used to evaluate the history of stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Hypertension wasdefined as a systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg or a dias-tolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg, or the fact that the patientwas taking antihypertensive medications. Drug histories inrelation to anti-hypertensive agents and lipid lowering agentswere also evaluated. Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serumcreatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum albumin, totalcholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-choles-terol concentrations were measured. Diabetic retinopathy wasevaluated by direct fundus examination and was graded accord-ing to the modified Airlie House Classification (27). Statistical analysis All continuous variables with normal distributions were expressed as means ±SD, while variables with skewed dis- tributions were expressed as medians with a range. Variablesnot normally distributed were logarithmically transformedbefore statistical analysis. The results of categorical data areexpressed as percentages. Student’s t-test and ANOVA wereused to compare the continuous variables between groups andthe chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The p value for a tr end was evaluated by the Mantel-Haenszel chi- square test. A level of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). RESULTS A total of 562 patients were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 59 ±10 yr; the mean duration of diabetes was 8.0±7.4 yr; and their mean eGFR was 71.3 ±11.5 mL/min per 1.73m2. There was a significant inverse correlation between ACR and eGFR (r=-0.651, p<0.001) (Fig. 1). In the patientsS76 J.H. An, Y.M. Cho, H.G. Yu, et al. Fig. 1.

Among 562 patients, 151 (26.9%) had renal insufficien- cy, defined as an eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Among these, the prevalence of normo-, micro-, and macroalbumin-uric patients was 29.1% (n=44), 33.1% (n=50), and 37.8%(n=57), respectively. After excluding the patients using RASinhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ang-iotensin II receptor blockers), the number of patients withrenal insufficiency was 51 and the prevalence of normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuric renal insufficiency was 35.3% (n=18),41.2% (n=21), and 23.5% (n=12), respectively (Table 1). The characteristics of the 151 patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2stratified according to their ACR, as shown in Table 2. Compared with microalbuminuric renalinsufficiency, normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency was asso-ciated with female predominance, shorter duration of dia-betes, lower BUN and creatinine, higher eGFR, and lowerHbA1c. In addition, patients with normoalbuminuric renalinsufficiency had a lower prevalence of hypertension and re-tinopathy, and a lower prevalence of using anti-hypertensivedrugs except RAS inhibitors. Among them, female predom-inance, lower HbA1c, shorter duration of diabetes, lower preva- lence of hypertension and retinopathy, and a lower prevalence of using antihypertensive drugs other than RAS inhibitorswere still significant, even after adjusting for their eGFR. Whenthe patients using RAS inhibitors were excluded, we obtainedsimilar results (data not shown). Next, we compared the char-acteristics of the patients with normoalbuminuric renal insuf-ficiency with those who had macroalbuminuric renal insuf- ficiency. The results showed very similar trends to those ofNormoalbuminuric Renal Insufficiency in Type 2 DM S77 Data are expressed as n (%).Normo- Micro- Macro- albuminuria albuminuria albuminuria All (n=562) eGFR ≥60 305 (74.2) 96 (23.4) 10 (2.4) eGFR <60 44 (29.1) 50 (33.1) 57 (37.8) Without eGFR ≥60 67 (81.7) 15 (18.3) 0 (0.0) RAS inhibitors eGFR < 60 18 (35.3) 21 (41.2) 12 (23.5) (n=133)Table 1.

Finally, we found that female predominance, shorter duration of diabetes, lower prevalence of hypertensionand retinopathy, and a lower prevalence of using antihyper-tensive dr ugs except RAS inhibitors showed significant trends across the degree of albuminuria. Table 3 compares the clinical characteristics of 349 patients with normoalbuminuria according to their eGFR. The patientswith normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency (n=44, 12.6%)were older, more likely to be female, had a higher prevalenceof using RAS inhibitors and statins, and a higher prevalenceof coronary artery disease. The patients with normoalbumin-uric renal insufficiency, who were not taking RAS inhibitorsor statins, showed similar results but they additionally showedhigher triglyceride levels (1.83 [0.59-8.20 ]vs. 1.69 [0.65- 6.53]mM/L, p=0.03; expressed as a median [range ]) and lower HDL-cholesterol levels (1.01 ±0.23 vs. 1.24 ±0.28 mM/L, p=0.02) compared to their counterparts with normal renal function. We evaluated the trend of changes in the prevalence of normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuric renal insufficiencyalong with the duration of the diabetes. The prevalence ofnormoalbuminuria decreased progressively, whereas the preva-lence of macroalbuminuria increased with an increase in the duration of diabetes (Mantel-Haenszel 2test, pfor trend <0.001) (Fig. 2).

The retinopathy and albuminuria wereboth absent in 37 of the 151 (24.5%) patients. In the nor-moalbuminuric renal insufficiency group, most of the patients(37 of 44 patients, 84.1%) had no retinopathy. The prevalenceand severity of retinopathy were markedly and progressivelyincreased in the micro- and macroalbuminuria groups (Man-tel-Haenszel chi-square test, pfor trend <0.001). DISCUSSION Among the Korean patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency, the prevalence of normoalbuminuria was 29.1%(35.3% in those not using RAS inhibitors). Even after adjust-ing for their eGFR, normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency wasassociated with female predominance, lower HbA1c, short-er duration of diabetes, lower prevalence of hypertension andretinopathy, and a lower prevalence of using antihypertensivedrugs except RAS inhibitors compared with microalbumin-uric renal insufficiency. These results are largely similar tothose from Caucasian studies (15-17). The characteristics ofa shorter duration of the diabetes and a lower prevalence ofretinopathy found in this study suggest that normoalbumin-uric renal insufficiency might be an earlier stage of renal insuf- ficiency compared with microalbuminuric renal insufficien- cy. This is further supported by the results that the prevalenceof normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency decreased with anincrease in the duration of the diabetes and with the advancedstage of retinopathy. Thus, it might be speculated that sometype 2 diabetic patients might face renal insufficiency with-out albuminuria and may then progress to microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric renal insufficiency as the duration oftype 2 diabetes increases. However, there are reports showingthat normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency was not associat-ed with a lower prevalence of retinopathy (15, 16). Further-more, Rigalleau et al. (17) reported that diabetic patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency showed stable AER over38 months and had a low risk for the progression to ESRDor death. Therefore, to support our hypothesis that normoal-buminuric r enal insufficiency might be an earlier stage of dia- betic renal complication, we need a prospective study includ-ing looking into the change of renal pathology. In the next step, we examined whether there was any dif- ference in the clinical characteristics of normoalbuminuricpatients according to their eGFR. Compared with the patientswith normoalbuminuria in the absence of renal insufficiency,those with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency were older,more likely to be female, had a higher prevalence of usingRAS inhibitors and statins, and a higher prevalence of coro-nary artery disease. The higher prevalence of coronary arterydisease suggests that other atherosclerotic diseases involvingthe renal vasculature might be responsible for the decreasedrenal function in the absence of albuminuria. In this regard,a recent report (18) also showed that normoalbuminuric renalinsufficiency was associated with metabolic syndrome. How-ever, MacIsaac et al. (16) found that patients with type 2 dia-betes and reduced GFR had similar degrees of intrarenal vas-cular disease, assessed by the intrarenal arterial resistance index. Therefore, at this time, the mechanism of normoalbuminuricrenal insufficiency still remains elusive. Interestingly, geneticsusceptibility might play a role in the development of nor-moalbuminuric renal insufficiency. It has been reported thatpolymorphisms of the protein kinase C- βgene (PRKCB1) were associated with diabetic nephropathy that did not leadto albuminuria in Japanese patients (28). A female predilection for normoalbuminuric renal insuf- ficiency has been noted in many other previous studies (14,15, 17, 18), but the reason for this association is unknown.In this study, the patients with normoalbuminuric renal insuf-ficiency were more likely to be females over 50 (odds ratio [OR]and 95% confidence interval [CI] was 3.08 [1.15-4.13 ], p=0.017), while we could not find this age effect in male sub- jects (OR and 95% CI was 1.38 [0.48-3.26 ], p=0.646) (data not shown in the Results). Therefore, the pathogenesis ofnormoalbuminuric renal insufficiency might be af fected by the hormonal change that occurs around menopause. There were several limitations in this study. First, owing to the cross-sectional design it was difficult to clarify thecausal relationship between the risk factors and the naturalcourse of the normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency. Second,the eGFR might not reflect the actual GFR of our studypopulation, since the MDRD study included very few Asians(29). Third, the assessment of AER with a single specimenmight not exactly estimate the number of normoalbumin-uric renal insufficiency. Finally, the number of the patientswith renal insufficiency not taking RAS inhibitors was some-what small. Therefore, a further study including sufficient number of patients in this category is necessary. In conclusion, normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency was prevalent in type 2 diabetic Korean patients and the clinicalcharacteristics were largely similar to those seen in previousstudies. The association with a shorter duration of the diabetesand a lower prevalence of retinopathy suggests that normoal-Normoalbuminuric Renal Insufficiency in Type 2 DM S79 Data are expressed as n (%). pfor trend <0.001 by Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test.Normo- Micro- Macro- albuminuria albuminuria albuminuria No retinopathy 37 (84.1) 22 (44.0) 11 (19.3)Non-proliferative, mild 5 (11.3) 10 (20.0) 7 (12.3)Non-proliferative, moderate 1 (2.3) 7 (14.0) 9 (15.8)Non-proliferative, severe 1 (2.3) 5 (10.0) 11 (19.3)Proliferative 0 (0) 6 (12.0) 19 (33.3)Table 4.
