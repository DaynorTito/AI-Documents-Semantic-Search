Email: burak_yazgan@yahoo.com Abstract Chronic kidney disease is a major global public health problem. The peptide hormones adropin and spexin modulate many physiological functions such as energy balance andglucose, lipid and protein metabolism. However, it is unclear whether these peptides may exert effects on renal damage, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory conditions. In view of the limited information, we aimed to investigate the effect of adropin and spexin on matrixmetalloproteinase and inflammatory response genes a rat model of adenine-induced chron-ic kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure was induced in rats by administering adenine hemi- sulfate. Renal function was determined in an autoanalyzer. Histopathological modifications were assessed by H&E staining. mRNA expression levels of ALOX 15, COX 1, COX 2, IL-1 b, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-18 IL-21, IL-33, KIM-1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP- 13, NGAL, TGF b1, TIMP-1, and TNF ain kidney tissue were measured by qPCR. Our results showed an increase of 24-h urine volume, serum creatinine, BUN, and urine protein levels ingroup with adenine-induced CKF. Adropin and spexin treatments decreased urine protein and 24-h urine volume. Renal damage, TIMP-1, IL-33, and MMP-2 increased after CKF induction, while COX 1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 levels were significantly reduced. Furthermore, KIM-1, TIMP-1, IL-33, and MMP-2 were downregulated by spexin treatment. Renal damage, NGAL, TIMP-1 IL- 17A, IL-33, MMP-2, and MMP-3 decreased after adropin treatment, while MMP-13 levels were upregulated. Treatment with adropin þspexin decreased KIM-1, NGAL, TIMP-1, IL-1 b, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-33, ALOX 15, COX 1, COX 2, TGF b1, TNF a, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-7, but increased MMP-13 levels. Our findings revealed that inflammatory response and MMP genes weremodulated by adropin and spexin. These peptides may have protective effects on inflammation and chronic kidney damage progression.

DOI: 10.1177/15353702211012417 Introduction Chronic kidney failure (CKF) provides a suitable environ- ment for the occurrence of many major diseases in chronickidney disease (CKD) patients. The condition mostlycauses or is caused by fibrosis in the kidneys and blood vessels setting the stage for other diseases. Renal fibrosishas been shown to be the most reliable predictor of theprogression of CKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 1 There are two important processes that determine theImpact statement The peptide hormones adropin and spexin modulate many physiological functions such as energy balance and glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. These hormonesmay play a protective role in the patho-genesis of many diseases such as diabe- tes, diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, endothelial dysfunction, heartfailure, and cardiovascular disease.However, it is unclear whether these pep- tides may exert effects on renal damage, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory con-ditions. Within this context, we investigatedthe protective effect of adropin and spexin on inflammation and MMPs in a rat model of chronic kidney failure. Our findingsrevealed that inflammatory response andMMP genes were modulated by adropin and spexin. These peptides may have protective effects on inflammation andchronic kidney damage progression. ISSN 1535-3702 Experimental Biology and Medicine 2021; 246: 1917–1927 Copyright !2021 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine course of chronic kidney failure: inflammation and fibrosis. The kidneys of CKF patients produce many inflammatory mediators due to the chronic inflammatory status, includ- ing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- a), interleukin 1 b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-21, and IL-33.2–5In addition, cyclooxygenases (COX) and arachidonate lipoxy-genases (ALOX) play an important role in the developmentof CKD by affecting both the production of inflammatorymediators and renal functions. 6,7 Kidney failure can be detected by few biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). KIM-1 indicates proximal tubule injury and NGAL is upregulated and secreted in response to kidney injury. 8,9These two bio- markers are also independent risk factors for progressionof CKD. Other important biomarkers, which have animpact in CKF patients, are matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). The formerare zinc-dependent endopeptidase. At least 28 MMPshave so far been identified. 10The family of MMPs is clas- sified based on sequence homology and substrate specific-ity into six groups: collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10), matrilysins (MMP-7, MMP-26), membrane-typeMMPs, and other MMPs. 11MMPs cleave many extracellu- lar matrix (ECM) components such as collagens and elas-tins, and play key roles in tissue homeostasis andremodeling. 12Besides their tissue-remodeling function, MMPs regulate many non-ECM molecules such asgrowth factors, cell surface receptors, adhesion molecules,cytokines, and chemokines. 13The activity of MMPs is tight- ly regulated by their endogenous inhibitors, known asTIMPs. 14Imbalances in MMP/TIMP levels have been linked to the structural changes that occur in the develop- ment of renal scarring, fibrosis, and inflammation.15All of these biomarkers are important for determining the effectsof CKF treatments and for disease prognosis. Spexin, a member of the spexin/galanin/kisspeptin family, has recently been identified as a novel peptide hor-mone by bioinformatic tools. 16,17The spexin peptide con- sists of 14 amino acids and a molecular weight ofapproximately 1.6 kDa. 17,18Spexin is broadly expressed in numerous tissues such as ovary, testis, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, brain, thyroid, adre- nal gland, spleen, adipose tissue, stomach, and GI tract.19 Spexin activates galanin receptor types 2 (GALR2) and 3(GALR3) in target cells. 20Thus, this peptide modulates many physiological functions such as feeding, energy bal-ance, lipid storage, arterial blood pressure, salt-water bal-ance, and cardiorenal responses. 21–23Recent studies also indicate that this hormone may modulate inflammatoryprocesses, but this mechanism is unclear. 24 Adropin, is a bioactive peptide hormone recently dis- covered by Kumar, which has a molecular weight of approximately 4.49 kDa.25,26This peptide is extensively expressed in numerous tissues such as the brain, heart,kidney, liver, pancreas, and GI tract. 27,28Adropin regulates energy balance and glucose, lipid and protein metabolismby activation of GPR19 in target cells. 29,30Several studies reported that low serum adropin levels may play a role inthe pathogenesis of many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, CKD, diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy.31–33 Moreover, adropin induces anti-inflammatory responses and may therefore exert a protective effect against the path-ogenesis of these diseases. 31,34However, few studies have investigated the effects of adropin on inflammatory status and MMPs. Within this context, we aimed to investigate the effect of adropin and spexin on MMP and inflammatory response genes in a rat model of adenine-induced CKF. Our findings revealed that inflammatory response and MMP genes weremodulated by adropin and spexin. These peptides may have protective effects on inflammation and chronic renal damage progression. Materials and methods Animals Twenty-five male Sprague Dawley rats (200–250 g), sup- plied by the Trakya University Animal Center, werehoused in an air-conditioned room under a 12-h light/ dark cycle, at a relative humidity of 65–70% and constant temperature (22 /C62 /C14C). The rats had free access to food and water. All experimental procedures were approved by theTrakya University Animal Research and Ethics Committee, Edirne, Turkey (Protocol number: TUHADYEK-2016/52). Experimental design The animals ( n¼25) were randomly divided into a vehicle group ( n¼5) and a CKF ( n¼20) group. The vehicle group received daily 5% carboxymethyl cellulose (1 mL/kg) by oral gavage for 10 days, followed by saline injected intra- peritoneally for four weeks. The CKF group received dailyadenine hemisulfate solution at a dose of 600 mg/kg and 5% carboxymethyl cellulose, 1 mL/kg (Sigma, cat no: A9126) by oral gavage for 10 days to induce CKF. 35,36 After the administration of adenine hemisulfate, the induction of kidney failure was confirmed by biochemical parameters (day 15 of the experiment). Following biochem- ical confirmation, the CKF group ( n¼20) was randomly divided into four groups: CKF (saline 1 mL/kg); adropin(2.1mg/kg/mL, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, cat no: 032–35); 37 spexin (35 mg/kg/mL, PolyPeptide, cat no: SC1547);22adro- pinþspexin (adropin; 2.1 mg/kg/mL, spexin; 35 mg/kg/ mL). The groups were treated daily for four weeks, five - days per week. All rats were then transferred to a metabolic cage for 24-h urine sampling without food or water restric-tion. Following sacrifice under anesthesia (100 mg/kg keta-mine, 12.5 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.), blood was collected by cardiac puncture and kidney tissues were removed. During the experiment, 24-h urine samples were collectedand urine volume was recorded in a metabolic cage five -days after the adenine hemisulfate treatment (day 15 of the experiment) and at the end of the adropin and/or spexin treatments (4th week). Blood samples were collected into aserum clot activator tube, centrifuged at 2000 g(10 min at 4 /C14C), and serum was taken on day 15 and at the end of the 4th week of treatment. Kidney tissues of each animal wereremoved, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at1918 Experimental Biology and Medicine Volume 246 September 2021............................................................................................................................... ................................ /C080/C14C for the qPCR assays. In addition, the kidney tissue samples were fixed in formaldehyde for pathological assessment. Renal function tests Serum creatinine and BUN levels and creatinine and pro- tein levels in 24-h urine samples were determined in a Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Architect C16000, Abbott Laboratories). The urine protein/creatinine ratio, proteinloss, and creatinine clearance were also calculated. Light microscopy examination of kidney tissue Kidney tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formal- dehyde, dehydrated in ethanol, incubated in xylol for 2 h, embedded in liquid paraffin, and cut into 5 lm thick sec- tions onto glass slides with an automatic slicing machine(Leica). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope (Leica) at 200/C2magnification to evaluate pathological changes. The severity of tubular necrosis was graded as follows: (1) <10% necrosis; (2) 10%–25% necrosis; (3) 25%–50% necro- sis; (4) 50%–75% necrosis, and (5) more than 75% necrosis. Gene expression analysis Kidney tissues (200 mg) were homogenized (IKA) and total RNA was isolated with the GeneJET RNA Purification Kit(Thermo Scientific). The concentration of total RNA in the samples was determined in a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go lDrop, Thermo). cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA using the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was used for quan-titative PCR (qPCR) using the Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) and the threshold cycle (CT) was determined with the PikoReal TMReal-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific). Relative gene expression levels of ALOX15, COX-1, COX-2, IL-1 b, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-18 IL-21, IL-33, KIM-1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7,MMP-9, MMP-13, NGAL, TGF- b1, TIMP-1, and TNF- a were calculated as a fold change using the 2 /C0DDCT method, where DCT¼CT (target gene)-CT (housekeeping gene, b-actin) and D(DCT)¼DCT (vehicle)- DCT (treat- ment). The primers used for qPCR are listed in Table 1. Estimated PCR product sizes and target gene specificitywere confirmed using NCBI Primer-BLAST (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Statistics Differences between the groups were evaluated statistically by ANOVA and the Mann–Whitney U test as a post hoc testusing the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. A pvalue<0.05 was accepted to be statistically significant. Data are pre- sented as mean /C6SD in the figures.Results Adropin and spexin attenuate renal function impairment Our results showed that adenine solution induced CKF, characterized especially by polyuria and proteinuria, inall rats. On day 15 of the experiment, serum creatinine (V:0.20/C60 mg/mL; CKF:1.0 /C60.32 mg/mL, p<0.001) and BUN (V: 39.07 /C63.10 mg/mL; CKF: 298.4 /C666.91 mg/mL, p<0.001) levels were increased in the CKF group com- pared to the vehicle group. In addition, adenine inductionincreased the 24-h urine volume (V: 9.35 /C63.60 mL; CKF: 45.25/C610.2 mL, p<0.001). Protein loss in 24-h urine was significantly increased by CKF induction (V: 2873 /C6 1933 mg/mL; CKF: 6187 /C61479 mg/mL, p<0.05). We also calculated the protein/creatinine ratio to show the metabol-ic breakdown and renal damage and observed that thisratio increased significantly with renal damage (CKF:21.16/C66.8; V: 3.90 /C60.64; r ¼0.688; p<0.01). Urine creati- nine levels were lower in the CKF groups probably due topolyuria. Adropin or spexin treatment did not cause anysignificant change in serum creatinine, BUN, or creatinineclearance levels, while adropin treatment reduced 24-h urine output (CKF: 50.17 /C610.89; CKF þA: 27.0 /C67.55, p<0.05) compared to the CKF group. Spexin exerted lower effects on urine creatinine. Additionally, urine creat-inine, urine protein, and daily protein loss were decreasedby adropin þspexin treatment compared to CKF (Table 2). Spexin and adropin have a protective effect on adenine- induced kidney damage The macroscopic assessment of the kidney focused on sur- face color and shape. The macroscopic picture of the kid- neys (Figure 1) showed a color change from red-brown towhite-brown in the CKF groups compared to the vehiclegroups. In addition, the surface of the kidney was notsmooth, indicating an abnormal kidney. Histopathological evaluation of the kidney tissues was performed by H&E staining (Figure 1). In the vehicle group,the kidneys displayed a normal renal tissue structure, uni-form tubules lined with a single epithelial layer, and noobvious pathological changes. The kidney tissue in theCKF group exhibited degenerative changes such as glomer-ular bulging, glomerular hypertrophy, tubular dilatation,and tubular necrosis. Adropin and adropin þspexin treat- ments significantly attenuated the severity of kidneydamage in the CKF group. Quantitative histopathologyshowed a significantly higher tubular necrotic index inrats of the CKF group compared to the vehicle group; con-versely, adropin and combined adropin þspexin treatments significantly reduced this elevated tubular necrotic index in CKF rats. The pathological changes in kidney tissue of theCKFþS group were similar to the CKF group. Additionally, for confirmation of the renal pathological condition, mRNA expression levels of the kidney injurymarkers KIM-1, NGAL, and TIMP-1 were assessed byqPCR (Figure 2). We observed that mRNA expression ofTIMP-1 was significantly increased (7 fold), while mRNAexpression levels of KIM-1 and NGAL remainedYazgan et al. Protective effect of adropin and spexin on CKF 1919............................................................................................................................... ................................ unchanged in the CKF group compared to vehicle groups. Also, KIM-1 and TIMP-1 were downregulated by CKF þS compared to CKF, but NGAL was unchanged. In addition,NGAL and TIMP-1 were downregulated by CKF þA com- pared to CKF, while KIM-1 was unchanged. Moreover,mRNA expression levels of KIM-1, NGAL and TIMP-1 were downregulated by combined adropin þspexin treatment. Spexin and adropin promote an anti-inflammatory response Following the determination of chronic kidney failure status, we evaluated alterations in the inflammatory response of kidney tissue. For this purpose, mRNA expres-sion levels of interleukin, proinflammatory, and anti-inflammatory genes were determined by qPCR. Asshown in Figures 3 and 4, IL-33 was significantly increasedin the CKF group compared to the vehicle group, althoughCOX-1 was significantly reduced. In addition, spexin treat- ment significantly decreased IL-33 gene expression com-pared to the CKF group. Adropin treatment alsodecreased IL-17A and IL-33 gene expression levels com-pared to the CKF groups. Additionally, mRNA expressionlevels of the IL-1 b, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-33, ALOX15, COX-1, COX-2, TGF- b1, and TNF- agenes were significantly down- regulated by combined adropin þspexin treatment com- pared to CKF. Spexin and adropin treatments significantly modulate MMP gene expression levels The effect of adenine-induced CKF development on the MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-13genes that regulate tissue regeneration was determinedby qPCR. As shown in Figure 5, our data indicate amarked increase in the mRNA expression of MMP-2 inthe CKF group compared to the vehicle group; however,Table 2.

MMP-9 and MMP-13 levels were significantly reduced. On the other hand, no difference in the gene expression ofMMP-1, MMP-3, or MMP-7 was observed between the CKF and vehicle groups. MMP-2 gene expression was sig- nificantly reduced by spexin treatment compared to theCKF group. Also, adropin treatment significantly downre-gulated MMP-2 and MMP-3 gene expression levels com-pared to the CKF group; conversely, MMP-13 levels were upregulated by adropin treatment. Moreover, combined adropin þspexin treatment significantly decreased MMP- 1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-7 levels compared to CKF,but increased MMP-13 levels.Discussion Chronic kidney failure is a chronic progressive renal loss of parenchymal function that is associated with a poor prog-nosis and high mortality. 38According to WHO data from 2015, 1.2 million people have died from kidney failure. The disease poses a heavy economic burden on families andsociety worldwide. CKF including renal tubular celldamage and death is the most common cause of CKD in hospitalized patients. 39,40Studies using rat models of CKF have shown that adenine hemisulfate solution significantlyincreases BUN, serum creatinine, glomerular damage,tubular necrosis, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory mediators. 35,41,42In addition, many inflammatory markers such as IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-18, IL-33, and TNF- aincrease during the progression of CKF.43,44Numerous studies involving CKD populations and disease-specific subgroups have shown associations between higher urinary and blood NGAL levels and the progression of kidney disease.45In both mice and rats, the increase in plasma KIM-1 levelsdirectly reflected the degree of histologic and functional kidney injury. 8 Within this context, we aimed to investigate the effect of adropin and spexin hormones on MMP and inflammatoryresponse genes in a rat model of CKF. Chronic kidney fail- ure was induced in rats by administering adenine hemi- sulfate solution. Our kidney function test results (Table 2)showed that BUN and serum creatinine levels significantlyincreased after the administration of adenine solution, as demonstrated in previous studies on adenine-induced CKF. We also found that protein excretion significantlyincreased, while creatinine levels in 24-h urine samples sig-nificantly decreased in the adenine-induced kidney failure group. We calculated the protein/creatinine ratio to dem- onstrate the metabolic breakdown and renal damage andwe observed a significant increase in this ratio with renaldamage. In addition, macroscopic observation showed a change in kidney color from red-brown to white-brown in the CKF groups compared to the vehicle groups. Also, ourlight microscopy findings indicated degenerative changessuch as glomerular bulging, glomerular hypertrophy, tubu- lar dilatation, and tubular necrosis in the CKF group (Figure 1). Besides, the tubular necrotic index of rats inthe CKF group was significantly greater compared to thevehicle group. For confirmation of the renal histopatholog- ical condition, we measured the gene expression levels of the kidney injury markers KIM-1, NGAL, and TIMP-1(Figure 2). TIMP-1 levels were significantly increased (7fold), while KIM-1 and NGAL levels remained unchanged in the CKF groups compared to the vehicle groups. Following the determination of CKF status, we evaluatedalterations in the inflammatory response of kidney tissue(Figures 3 and 4). Our findings indicated that IL-33 was significantly increased in the CKF group compared to the vehicle group, although COX-1 was significantly decreasedby CKF. No difference in the expression levels of the othergenes was observed between the CKF and vehicle groups. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidase. 10These enzymes cleave many ECM components such as collagens and elastins and play key roles in tissue homeostasis and Figure 1.

Moreover, Tveitara ˚set al.51found that MMP-2 KO mice are protected from kidney fibrosis.MMP-9 plays an important role in development of CKD.According to some studies, the activity of MMP-9 isincreased in the early stage of CKD, but decreases in theadvanced stage of CKD. 11Some studies observed that glo- merular expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 decreased indiabetic rats. MMP-1 expression was also reduced in allox-an induced-diabetic mice, whereas local application ofMMP-1 into the kidneys of mice prevented diabetic renalfibrosis. 52–54Ren et al.55showed that Twist1 in infiltrating inflammatory macrophages enhances kidney fibrosis viadownregulation of MMP-13; upregulation of MMP-13also reduces fibrotic progression. However, another studyon mice suggests that poricoic acid, which is an MMP-13inhibitor, ameliorates renal fibrosis by suppressing MMP- 13 activity. 56 Our results indicated a marked increase in the mRNA expression of MMP-2 in the CKF group compared to the vehicle group; however, MMP-9 and MMP-13 levels were significantly reduced by CKF. On the other hand, no differ- ence in the gene expression of MMP-1 or MMP-3 was observed between the CKF and vehicle groups (Figure 5). The peptide hormone spexin regulates many physiolog- ical pathways, including feeding, energy balance, lipid storage, arterial blood pressure, salt-water balance, and car- diorenal responses.21,22Toll et al.23showed that intracere- broventricular injection of spexin peptide decreased urine flow rate. Spexin has recently been shown to influence the inflammatory response. Kumar et al. found that spexin levels decrease with obesity progression and that this pep-tide is negatively correlated with IL-6. 57Similarly, in anoth- er study on obesity progression, spexin levels were found to be negatively correlated with hs-CRP.58Behrooz et al. showed that some serum inflammatory markers such as IL-10, IL-1 b, and hs-CRP were closely associated with spexin levels in obese children.59Furthermore, Gambaro et al.24observed that the inflammatory markers IL-6, 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 V CKF CKF+S CKF+A CKF+A+SmRNAexpression(foldchange)ALOX-15 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 V CKF CKF+S CKF+A CKF+A+SmRNAexpression(foldchange)COX-1 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 VC K F C K F + S C K F + A C K F + A + SmRNAexpression(foldchange)COX-2 00.20.40.60.811.21.4 V CKF CKF+S CKF+A CKF+A+SmRNAexpression(foldchange)TGF-β1 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 V CKF CKF+S CKF+A CKF+A+SmRNAexpression(foldchange)TNF-α+* +++ ¥¥ ++ ¥¥+ ¥ + Figure 4.

Protective effect of adropin and spexin on CKF 1923............................................................................................................................... ................................ TNF- a, and IL-1 bdecreased after spexin administration in obese mice. However, the number of studies investigating the effects of spexin on kidney failure and inflammatory response is limited. Our results revealed that spexin treatment exerts only reduced effects on urine creatinine in renal function tests. In addition, the kidney tissue in the CKF þS group showed a macroscopic appearance and pathological changes similarto those of the CKF group. Also, KIM-1 and TIMP-1 were downregulated by spexin treatment compared to CKF, but NGAL was unchanged. Moreover, IL-33 gene expressionwas significantly decreased by spexin treatment compared to the CKF group. Spexin treatment also significantly decreased MMP-2 gene expression compared to the CKFgroup. Adropin regulates energy balance and glucose, lipid and protein metabolism pathways by activation of GPR19receptors in target cells. Several studies suggested thatthis hormone may exert a protective effect against the path- ogenesis of many diseases such as diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, CKD, and heart failure. 29,31–33Some studies have shown that serum adropin levels are negatively cor- related with BUN and serum creatinine and a positive cor- relation with eGFR was reported.31,60Besides, adropin mayalter inflammatory responses.27,37,61Sato et al.62showed that adropin treatment suppressed TNF- ainduced THP1 monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), indicating the anti-inflammatory effect of this peptide. Ibrahim et al.63found that the inflammatory response markers IL-6 and TNF- awere negatively correlat- ed with serum adropin levels in a diabetic nephropathic rat model. Furthermore, Gao et al.64showed that adropin defi- ciency in AdrKO mice increased the production of IL-1 a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-33, and TNF- a. In addition, adropin admin- istration to HUVECs and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) significantly increased the protein expression of fibronectin and elastin but not of collagen 1, collagen 3,MMP-2, or MMP-9. 62 Our findings indicate that adropin treatment reduced 24-h urine output compared to the CKF group. Besides, adropin treatment significantly reduced the elevated tubu- lar necrotic index compared to CKF rats. NGAL and TIMP- 1 were downregulated by CKF þA compared to CKF, while KIM-1 was unchanged. Our findings show that adropin treatment significantly attenuated the severity of renal injury in CKF. Furthermore, adropin treatment decreased IL-17A and IL-33 gene expression levels compared to the CKF groups.

Combined adropin þspexin treatment reduced urine cre- atinine and urine protein loss compared to the CKF group.Similarly, adropin þspexin treatment significantly attenuat- ed the severity of renal injury and tubular necrotic index inthe CKF group. Also, mRNA expression levels of KIM-1,NGAL, and TIMP-1 were downregulated by combinedadropin þspexin treatment. Moreover, combined adropin þ- spexin treatment significantly downregulated IL-1 b, IL- 17A, IL-18, IL-33, ALOX15, COX-1, COX-2, TGF- b1, and TNF- aexpression levels compared to CKF. Furthermore, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-7 levels were significantlydecreased by combined adropin þspexin treatment com- pared to CKF; conversely, MMP-13 levels were increasedby this treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate a protective role of adropin and adropin þspexin in CKF, modulating renal damage, MMPs, and inflammatory responses. However,spexin exerts a limited effect on CKF. Further studies onthese peptides are needed.
