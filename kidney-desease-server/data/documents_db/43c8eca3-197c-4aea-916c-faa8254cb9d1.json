Clinical presentation is highly variable and prognostic factors for clinical course and outcome are not well established. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 62 patients with TMA, 22 males and 40 females aged 16 to 76 years, treated with plasma exchange at one center to identify clinical risk factors for the development of renalinsufficiency. Results: On admission, 39 of 62 patients (63%) had acute renal failure (ARF) with 32 patients (52%) requiring dialysis treatment. High systolic arterial pressure (SAP, p = 0.009) or mean arterial pressure (MAP, p = 0.027) on admission was associated with acute renal failure. Patients with SAP .140 mmHg on admission had a sevenfold increased risk of severe kidney disease (OR 7.464, CI 2.097–26.565). MAP .100 mmHg indicated a fourfold increased risk for acute renal failure (OR 4.261, CI 1.400–12.972). High SAP, diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and MAP on admission were also independent risk factors for persistent renal insufficiency with the strongest correlation for high MAP. Moreover, a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level on admission correlated with renal failure in the course of the disease (p = 0.003). At discharge, renal function in11 of 39 patients (28%) had fully recovered, 14 patients (23%) remained on dialysis, and 14 patients (23%) had non-dialysis- dependent chronic kidney disease. Seven patients (11%) died. We identified an older age as risk factor for death. Conclusions: High blood pressure as well as high CRP serum levels on admission are associated with renal insufficiency in TMA. High blood pressure on admission is also a strong predictor of sustained renal insufficiency. Thus, adult TMA patientswith high blood pressure may require special attention to prevent persistent renal failure. Citation: Dierkes F, Andriopoulos N, Sucker C, Kuhr K, Hollenbeck M, et al.

Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) such as HUS or TTP are rare microangiopathic thrombotic disorders characterized by hyaline thrombi in the arterial microvasculature, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Prior to the introduc- tion of plasma infusion and plasma exchange therapy, TMA was associated with a mortality rate of more than 90% in adults [1,2]. In recent years, with the advent of plasma exchange in TMAmortality rate could be drastically decreased, but TMA can still be viewed as a life-threatening disorder with the outcome depending on the underlying disease, the age of the patient, severity of organ damage (e.g. kidney, heart, brain), and on the time lapse between the onset of symptoms and initiation of plasma therapy.A variety of possible triggers such as gastrointestinal infection with E.coli O157:H7 ,E.coli O104:H4 orShigella for typical HUS and genitourinary or respiratory infections, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hormonal dysbalance, drugs, tumours, inherited and acquired defects in complement components and autoim- mune diseases for TTP and adult atypical HUS have been identified [3,4,5]. However, in up to 30% of cases the underlying cause remains unclear. Recently, a large outbreak of E.coli O104:H4 in Germany demonstrated the clinical severity of this disease [6]. New pathophysiological approaches identified a low activity of ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleavage of unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULvWF) multimers, to be responsible for TTP development [3,7,8]. However, according to PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30886 epidemiologic studies ADAMTS13 activity was reduced below 5% in only 15% of patients with TMA [9], suggesting the presence of additional unrecognized risk factors predisposing for the onset andclinical course of TMA. Patients with atypical HUS may have adeficiency of complement factor H or auto-antibodies directed against this protein. Furthermore, mutations in the membrane cofactor protein gene (MCP/CD46), in the complement factor Igene, in the complement factor B gene or in the thrombomodulingene may also be present [10,11,12]. In atypical HUS and selectedShiga-toxin-induced HUS cases the humanized monoclonal anti- C5 antibody eculizumab was reported to be beneficial [13,14,15]. In contrast to HUS patients, classic TTP patients usually presentwith predominant neurological symptoms. Since there is consid-erable clinical overlap between these two entities the disease is often referred to as HUS/TTP [16]. Presently, there is a need for risk stratification to guide therapy and follow-up. Therefore, we analysed 62 consecutive adult patients with TMA admitted to our hospital between 1989 and 2006. Methods Study design The aim of this study was to identify clinical risk factors for acute renal failure, persistent renal insufficiency and for mortality in adultTMA patients. Data of 62 patients (22 males, 40 females)consecutively admitted to our hospital between June 1989 andJune 2006 at the age of 16 to 76 years with their first episode of acute TMA were analyzed. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Du ¨sseldorf University as exempt research without requirement for informed consent as this wasreview of existing data. TMA was diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria: thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/ ml, Coombs- negative hemolytic anemia (Hb ,12 g/dl, LDH .240 U/l), and the presence of more than two schistocytes per visual field in theperipheral blood smear. Other causes of severe thrombocytopenia, in particular disseminated intravascular coagulation or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, were excluded. Almost all patients inthis study were treated with plasmapheresis. 57 of the patientsunderwent plasma exchange therapy within 12 hours after admission; three patients received plasma infusion due to less severe disease. Two patients died from severe cerebral hemorrhagebefore initiation of plasma therapy. Medical records of all patientswere examined for clinical signs of TMA and potential risk factors for the disease. In this study, we did not classify patients into TTP, HUS, or overlap syndromes by determining ADAMTS13 levels,factor H, B, I, MCP or thrombomodulin gene mutations [11,12,17]because these data were only available in a subset of patients. Furthermore, although the concept of ADAMTS13 deficiency or mutations in complement factors being responsible for thedevelopment of TMA is important, TMA patients still represent avery heterogenous group. Thus, the known pathophysiologicapproaches are applicable to some, but not all TMA patients [9,12,18,19,20]. Clinical parameters (age, sex, SAP, DAP, MAP, white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, LDH, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), CRP) were analysed on admission and at discharge. For plasmapheresis, we routinelyadministered 250 mg methylprednisolone i.v. per day initially forthe first three days followed by 1–4 mg/kg body weight of prednisone orally per day, usually at the same time as plasma therapy. Acute renal failure (ARF) in patients with no prior history of kidney disease was defined by an increase of serum creatininelevels of .0.5 mg/dl in 48 hours. In patients with renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine $1.5 mg/dl) ARF was defined by a rise in serum creatinine of $1 mg/dl from baseline over a period of 48 hours. Patients with elevated serum creatinine $1.5 mg/dl at discharge were categorized to have persistent renal insufficiency. All patients were treated on the intensive careunit (ICU) until platelet levels rose to more than 50 000/ ml. Symptomatic treatment consisted of blood pressure control,electrolyte and water balance control, and whole blood transfu-sions if necessary. ‘‘Remission’’ was defined as normalization of serum creatinine #1.2 mg/dl and reversal of neurological symptoms. All patients categorized as remission did not exhibit proteinuria at the time of discharge. Systolic blood pressure was normalized in 9 of 11patients with renal insufficiency on admission and remission atdischarge. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized in all thesepatients. Statistical Analysis The objective of this study was (1) to analyse potential differences between patients with renal impairment and patientswith normal renal function on admission, (2) to find potential riskfactors for persistent renal insufficiency and (3) to find potentialrisk factors for mortality. For this purpose we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and performed pairwise compar-isons for the baseline factors CRP, blood pressure, platelets, LDHand white blood cell count (WBC). Additionally, SAP and MAPwere defined with 140 and 100 mmHg as cut-off, and odds ratios(OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed to describe the strength of association between these factors and the renal status on admission (situation 1). For persistent renal insufficiency, the prognostic impacts of the baseline factors were first explored one at a time by logisticregression analyses, adjusted for renal status on admission. Factorsassociated with a p value of the Wald type ,20% were examined more closely in a multivariate logistic regression model, usingforward selection. Results are expressed as OR with their 95% CI.The variables CRP, WBC, platelets and LDH were natural logarithm transformed for inclusion in regression analyses (situation 2). In situation 3, we analysed additionally to the parameters from situation 1 and 2 the factors age, haemoglobin, schistocytes andcreatinine. Due to small sample sizes, a logistic regression analysiswas not feasible, thus we used a non-parametric Mann Whitneytest and performed pairwise comparisons for surviving anddeceased patients. If not stated otherwise, continuous variables were presented as median (interquartile range (IQR)), categorical variables werepresented as proportions (%). Because of the explorative characterof this study we did not adjust the significance level a= 0.05 to account for multiple testing. Therefore, all p-values are of anexplorative nature and p values ,0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All reported p-values are two-sided. Theanalyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0.3 forWindows (SPSS 2010, Chicago, Il., USA). Results Clinical characteristics of patients on initial presentation 62 consecutive patients diagnosed with adult TMA were analysed in this study (table 1). Median age at presentation was35 years with a wide range of 16 to 76 years (interquartile range(IQR): 27–49). Two thirds of our patients were female. 82% ofpatients only had a single episode of TMA whereas 18% relapsedIndicators of Renal Damage in TMA PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30886 at least once during the study period. Half of our patients exhibited neurological impairment varying from less severe symptoms suchas headache and dizziness to severe seizures and coma. Renalinsufficiency at presentation was very common (table 1). Most ofour patients had no history of renal insufficiency prior to their firstTMA episode. In patients with history of chronic renal failure, 3patients had received a renal transplant, 2 patients had SLE, andone patient had scleroderma. The different underlying causes of TMA in our patients are summarized in table 1. 31% of all patients had no obvious clinicaltrigger for the development of TMA. 19% of our patients were known to suffer from hypertension prior to the onset of TMA, whereas 81% did not show any medicalhistory of hypertension. Clinical outcome At discharge, remission (no renal insufficiency, no proteinuria, no neurological symptoms) was achieved in 42% of patients(table 2). Renal failure had resolved in 11 of 39 patients. Thenumber of dialysis-dependent patients decreased from 52% to23% (table 2). Only two patients, one with renal insufficiency onadmission and one without, still had a neurological deficit atdischarge. Among those patients with no previous hypertension,32% required antihypertensive treatment at the time of discharge.7 patients with TMA died (table 2), one of sepsis, three ofsevere cerebral hemorrhage, and three of TMA-associatedacute myocardial infarction where immediate lysis therapy wasunsuccessful.Clinical markers for renal insufficiency on admission C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on admission were significantly higher in patients with renal insufficiency compared to patientswith normal renal function (table 3, figure 1). Taking the medianof CRP values (2.7 mg/dl) to divide patients into two subgroups,10 patients with CRP $2.7 mg/dl had infections whereas 20 patients did not have signs of infection (6 patients with unknowntrigger of TMA, 5 patients post-partum, 3 patients with tumour, 3patients with drug-induced TMA, 2 patients with SLE). Blood pressure levels, MAP and SAP, were also significantly higher in patients with renal impairment on admission (table 3,figure 1). Patients with SAP .140 mmHg on admission had a sevenfold increased probability of renal insufficiency on admission(odds ratio (OR) 7.464, CI 2.097–26.565). Patients withMAP.100 mmHg on admission had a fourfold increased probability (OR 4.261, CI 1.400–12.972) of acute renal insuffi-ciency. There was a tendency for lower DAP in patients withnormal renal function. Platelet count was significantly lower inpatients with normal renal function (Table 3). This finding reflectsthe high proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP inthis group who often present with very low thrombocyte countsbut with normal renal function. No significant difference wasobserved for LDH levels or white blood cell count (WBC), asdescribed previously [21]. In our study, schistocytes remained elevated in some patients although LDH levels and platelet count were already normalized(data not shown). Therefore, as published earlier [22], schistocyteswere unreliable markers for the detection of disease activity.Table 1.

We performed logistic regression analyses, adjusted forrenal status on admission (table 4), comparing patients onadmission and at discharge. Potential risk factors influencing renalstatus at discharge were high MAP, SAP, DAP, and LDH levels onadmission (table 4). We observed a strong association of elevatedMAP on admission with renal insufficiency at discharge inmultivariate analysis (table 5). An increase in MAP by 10 mmHgwas associated with a twofold increased chance for renalinsufficiency at discharge. This finding indicates that patients with renal dysfunction on admission as well as at discharge have higherblood pressure levels compared to patients with normal renal function. In our logistic regression analysis (table 4), LDH levels were higher in patients with renal impairment on admission and atdischarge compared to patients with normal renal function. Risk factors for death from TMA The only associated risk factor for death in our study population was older age (table 6). MAP, SAP, DAP, LDH levels, CRP levels,WBC, haemoglobin levels, thrombocyte counts, schistocyte levels orcreatinine levels were not significantly different in patients who diedfrom TMA compared to surviving patients. Multivariate analysiswas not performed due to the small number of deceased patients. Figure 1. Risk factors for renal insufficiency in TMA.

Nowadays, survival rateshave significantly improved, but sporadic non-Shiga-toxin-in-duced HUS still has a mortality rate of up to 50% in some patientsubgroups [17]. The 2011 outbreak of E.coli O104:H4 in Germany demonstrated the severity of this disease very clearly, where at least27 patients died from diarrhea-associated HUS [6]. This study was designed to evaluate clinical risk factors predisposing TMA patients to renal insufficiency. The clinicalcourse of a single patient presenting with TMA is often difficult to predict. Therefore, we analyzed data of 62 consecutively treated TMA patients to identify markers for the development of renalinsufficiency and for the lack of renal recovery after successfulTMA treatment. Attempts to clinically define prognostic factors for the development of renal insufficiency in TMA have already been made earlier [21,23,24,25]. Hollenbeck and co-workers demon- strated the importance of plasmapheresis to prevent thedevelopment of end-stage renal disease compared to plasmainfusion alone [21]. In three studies pre-existing nephropathy or severe renal involvement were identified as risk factors for chronic renal failure [23,24,25]. Four studies correlated chronicrenal failure to the severity of arterial and glomerular damage on renal biopsy [23,24,25], whereas one study did not find any correlation between renal histology and renal prognosis [21].Compared to the present analysis patient subgroups weredifferent. In the study by Hollenbeck et al. only 71% of patients were treated with plasmapheresis. Tostivint and colleagues reported exclusively on HUS patients, not on TTP patients,mostly treated with plasma infusion [23], with a large cohort of HIV positive cases. In our study patients were treated almostexclusively with plasmapheresis. Acute renal failure (ARF) in TMA patients is frequently seen. In our study, more than 60% of patients showed renalimpairment at presentation confirming results that have beenpublished earlier (for review, see [17],[26],[27]). We identifiedhigh CRP and high blood pressure as clinical markers associatedwith ARF in TMA patients. CRP serum levels on admissionwere significantly increased in patients with ARF compared topatients with normal renal function. Therefore, high CRP mayserve as a risk factor for ARF in TMA. CRP is a non-specific acute phase protein synthesized and degraded in the liver. It is markedly elevated in septic states in which ARF develops with aprevalence of 9–40% [28]. In our study, sepsis only played aminor role as a potential cause of ARF. The reason for highCRP levels in our patient subgroup with ARF is unclear. Theyusually occur in response to infection and inflammation. In therenal insufficiency group they may reflect additional, clinicallyundetected infection, possibly facilitating the development ofARF. Since WBC was not elevated in patients with higher CRPlevels it is unlikely that severe infections were the reason for CRPelevation. Therefore, high CRP levels should rather be interpreted as an indicator for the severity of TMA-induced organ damage, including the kidney. Going along the same linewith our observation, a Japanese study on diarrhea-associatedtypical HUS in children (D +HUS) identified high CRP serum levels as a risk factor for the development of severe CNSdisorders [29]. High CRP has also been recognized as aprognostic indicator in chronic renal disease. [30,31]. SerumCRP levels predict death in dialysis patients [32,33]. In severerenal insufficiency, elevation of CRP is associated with a higherTable 4. Risk factors for renal insufficiency at discharge.

CRP might therefore play an active role in endothelial damage also in TMA patients, independently of its elevation in septic states. Thus, high CRP levels may reflect TMA activity itself, leading to more severe end-organ damage and ARF. In our cohort, high blood pressure (MAP) in patients with renal insufficiency on admission was a risk factor for acute and persistent renal insufficiency. Tostivint and co-workers already indicated that high DAP was associated with chronic renal failure but they did not identify high DAP as independent risk factor in multivariate analysis [23]. Higher blood pressure is either due to pre-existing hypertension or due to secondary hypertension caused by TMA- related renal involvement. Interestingly, only a minority of patients was known to be hypertensive prior to their episode of TMA. Most of our patients also did not have any previous history of kidney disease. Our data suggest that adequate treatment of hypertension in TMA patients may be essential to prevent additional renal damage. By lowering blood pressure into the normal range renal function might be preserved and may lead to a better renal outcome. LDH serum levels at the time of admission were higher in patients with sustained renal insufficiency at discharge compared to patients with normal renal function. This finding is not surprising since LDH levels indicate the severity of hemolysis and of end-organ damage. Higher LDH levels in patients with persisting renal insufficiency suggest a more severe course of TMA and presumably also more severe kidney damage. Several risk factors for the development of TMA, such as infection, pregnancy, autoimmune disease or drugs, have been published. We found these to be present in 69% of our patients. One third of patients did not show any apparent trigger. Genetic testing of genes encoding complement factors and determinationof ADAMTS13 activity have been demonstrated to be useful to clarify the etiology of TMA [12]. Recent studies show that 20% of HUS patients have a familiar form of HUS [26], and 80% of TTP is triggered by deficient activity of ADAMTS13 [12]. Unfortunately, these data were only available in a minority of our patients.11% of patients in our study died due to sepsis, hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction. This mortality rate is compa- rable to mortality rates previously published for this disorder [17,25,36]. We identified older age as a risk factor for deathconfirming results of Shiepatti and co-workers [24]. We did notobserve any association between risk of death and blood pressure, CRP serum levels, LDH serum levels, Hb, WBC, thrombocytes, schistocytes, or creatinine serum levels on admission. Datapublished earlier suggested that low hemoglobin levels as wellas high WBC were also associated with a higher risk of death [21]. In our study, we were not able to confirm these findings. This may reflect differences between patient subgroups in bothstudies. For interpretation of this study some limitations should be taken into account. The study took place in a single hospital with aparticular clientele of patients that might be different compared to hospitals in other regions or other countries. For example, we did not observe any HIV infections in our patient cohort. Further-more, a single site investigation often presents data on only alimited number of cases. In summary, we were able to identify parameters significantly correlated with unfavorable outcomes in TMA patients. HighCRP serum levels and high blood pressure indicate a predispo- sition for ARF and persistent renal insufficiency. These parameters could help to detect TMA patients at risk for sustained kidneyfunction impairment. Therapy of the underlying cause of CRPelevation as well as immediate and sufficient lowering of blood pressure may improve renal prognosis.
