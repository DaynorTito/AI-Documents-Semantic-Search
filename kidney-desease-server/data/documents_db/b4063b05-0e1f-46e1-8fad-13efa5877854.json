Many drugs are eliminated via the kidneys and thus require dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency. This is the first study to address the prevalence of renal insufficiency among nursing home residents in Germany, and the extent to which such persons take drugs that are contraindicated or incorrectly dosed because of renal insuffi-ciency. Method: We carried out a cross-sectional study in nursing homes in the Ger-man regions of Bremen and Lower Saxony. Data were collected by nursing staff and given to us anonymously. Whenever the nursing home data did not include a current creatinine value, the patient’s general practitioner was asked to supply this value. The estimated creatinine clearance (eCCr) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Results: 852 residents of 21 nursing homes were included in the study; eCCr values were obtainable for 685 (80.4%) of them (average age, 83.3 years; 75.2% female). 48.2% of these patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.8–54.5) had moderate renal insufficiency (eCCr 59–30 mL/min), and 15.5% (95% CI 12.4–18.6) had severe renal insufficiency (eCCr <30 mL/min). 19.7% were regularly taking at least one medication that was contraindicated or in- correctly dosed in the light of renal insufficiency. Predictors for such inappro- priate drug use were advanced age, female sex, arterial hypertension, and polypharmacy. The drugs that were most often inappropriately used were metformin, ramipril, and potassium chloride. Conclusion: Nursing home residents often suffer from renal insufficiency and should therefore have their creatinine levels measured regularly. A knowledge of the creatinine level is a prerequisite for the proper adjustment of drug doses (if necessary). A practical and compact summary of dose-adjustment recom-mendations for patients with renal insufficiency would be desirable but is not yet available. ►Cite this as: Hoffmann F , Boeschen D, Dörks M, Herget-Rosenthal S, Petersen J, Schmiemann G: Renal insufficiency and medication in nursing home residents—a cross-sectional study (IMREN). Dtsch Arztebl Int 2015; 112: 92–8. DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2016.0092About 800 000 people in Germany live in nursing homes (1). This is a population characterized by a high prevalence of chronic diseases and by physical and cognitive impairment (2–6) . According to the inter- national literature, the percentage of nursing home resi- dents with renal insufficiency, defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <60 mL/min, is very high, ranging between 22% and 78% (7–12). However, at present no reliable figures are available for Germany. In addition, nursing home residents often receive multiple drugs (6, 13). Since about 50% of all drugs or their metabolites are renally eliminated, this particular patient group is at considerably increased risk of inap-propriate drug therapy (14). The most frequent causes of inappropriate drug therapy in older persons and nursing home residents relate to prescription (dosage too high, dose intervals too short), compliance, and/or lack of treatment monitoring (15–17). The conse-quences can in some cases include severe adverse drug events (AE) leading to hospital admission or even death. However, most of these AE in nursing home residents are classified as potentially avoidable or reducible (16, 17). In patients with renal insufficiency, lack of dose adjustment or the use of drugs that are con-traindicated for the patient’s level of renal function are of particular significance. The few international studies that have been carried out in the nursing home setting show that 12% to 29% of residents receive at least one drug at an inappropriate dosage (18–20). The range of drugs included in the various studies varies widely. How often nursing home residents in Germany receive drugs that are not adjusted for their renal function, or are contraindicated, is unknown. The aims of this study were therefore to investigate what percentage of nursing home residents have renal insufficiency and how often drugs are inappropriately dosed or are contraindicated for the patient’s renal function. Methods Data and study design The “Inappropriate Medication in Patients with Renal Insufficiency in Nursing Homes” (IMREN) project is a multicenter cross-sectional study carried out between October 2014 and April 2015 in nursing homes in Department of Health Services Research, Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg: Prof. Dr. P .H.

A convenience sample was taken of nursing homes that were heterogeneous in terms of supporting organization, size, and location. Within this sample, data were recorded for all residents of the participating care units of the homes. There were no exclusion criteria. Data collection was anonymized; data were recorded exclusively by the nursing staff in the nursing homes, using a piloted data collection form to which the patient’s current medication regimen was attached. Active participation of the residents was not required for this study, which relied exclusively on existing data. Data collected included sociodemographic information such as age and sex, height and weight, diseases present, and care level. Up-to-date plasma creatinine concentrations were taken from care notes or hospital discharge letters; if no data were present, the care personnel requested them from the patient’s general practitioners. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated as estimated creati-nine clearance (eCCr) using the Cockcroft–Gault equation, because this is used in published studies (18–20) and as the reference in the summary of product characteristics (SPC). The Cockcroft–Gault equation includes the following variables: age, sex, body weight, and creatinine concentration (eFigure) (21). All data collection forms were computerized by two people independently of each other. The electronic data collection regarding medication regimens was done exclusively by pharmacists. For each drug prescribed, the summary of product characteristics was used as a basis to determine whether the drug was contraindi-cated or required dosage adjustment in patients with impaired renal function ( eTable). Each prescription was individually assessed for whether the dosage was ap-propriate or the drug contraindicated for the resident’s current level of renal function. If the SPC merely men-tioned dose adjustment without giving further details, we made the conservative assumption that the drugs had been correctly adjusted. All dosages were regarded as maintenance dosages. If starting dosages adjusted to the renal function had been required, this could not be taken into account because of the lack of information about treatment duration. All analyses are confined exclusively to scheduled medication. Drugs taken “as needed” and extemporaneous products were not included in the analysis. Sample size calculation Assuming a prevalence of renal insufficiency of 45% and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 (22), the intention was to enroll a total of 856 residents in 19 homes (n = 45 per home), in order to calculate a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) with a precision of ± 4% (41% to 49%). Statistical analysis All residents for whom at least one eCCr value could be computed were included. The prevalence of moderate (eCCr 59 to 30 mL/min, corresponding to stage 3 in ICD-10) and severe renal insufficiency (eCCr <30 mL/ min, corresponding to stages 4 and 5) was calculated on the basis of the most recent creatinine values available.

Logistic regression was used to determine which variables were associated with inappropriately dosed or contraindicated drugs for the patient’s current renal function. Predictors included in the model were age, sex, care level, polypharmacy ( ≥5 scheduled medications), and the most frequent co-morbidities. All analyses were cluster-adjusted; for regression analysis, mixed models with random effects were used. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, USA) was used for all analyses. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Bremen. Results Baseline data of the study population A total of 852 residents (10 to 69 per home) of 21 homes were enrolled (11 in Bremen, 10 in the parts of Lower Saxony surrounding Bremen). At least one eCCr value could be calculated for 685 of these 852 residents (80.4%; 30% to 100% per home). The two groups (those with and those without at least one eCCr value) did not differ significantly in terms of baseline charac-teristics ( Table 1). The analysis reported here is confined to residents with eCCr values. They had an average age of 83.3 years, three quarters of them were female, and they had been in the nursing home for an average of 3.2 years. More than a quarter of the resi- dents had been assessed at care level III, and more than half had dementia. Renal insufficiency A total of 63.6% (95% CI: [55.8; 71.5]) had renal insuf-ficiency (eCCr <60 mL/min), 48.2% of which with an eCCr of 59–30 and 15.5% with an eCCr of <30 mL/min (Table 2). A constant decline in renal function with age was shown. Thus, severe renal insufficiency (eCCr <30 mL/min) was found in 1.4% of <70-year-olds, but in 29.8% of residents aged at least 90 years. Female nursing home residents had poorer renal function than male residents, although the average age of female resi- dents was also higher (85.0 vs. 78.3 years). The only significant difference between the sexes was in the 70 to 79 year-old age group (eCCr <60 mL/min was 12.5% [4.9; 20.1] in men and 44.0% [26.8; 61.2]) in women; however, case numbers were low. The most recent creatinine value was a mean of 185 days old (interquartile range [IQR] 67 to 373). In a third of cases (31.6%) it was taken from the hospital discharge letter; in the remaining cases it was requested from the patient’s general practitioner or was recorded in the care notes. The values from both sources were of similar recency (median 185 and 188 days old, respec -tively). If only the 507 residents (74.1%) whose most recent creatinine values were from the previous 365 days are included, the results are the same as when all residents with recorded values are included (48.9% with an eCCr of 59 to 30 mL/min and 15.8% with an eCCr <30 mL/ min). Medication adjustment The 685 residents were receiving a total of 4316 drugs as scheduled medication, of which 2184 (50.6%) were potentially contraindicated or required dosage adjust-ment in patients with impaired renal function. The most frequently used of these were ramipril, simvastatin, and torasemide (Table 3 ). However, in only a small number of cases (n = 169; 7.7%) were these actually being in-correctly used in relation to the given patient’s renal function, because the drug was inappropriately dosed (n = 54) or was contraindicated (n = 115) for the pa-tient’s eCCr value. This was most often the case for metformin, ramipril, and potassium chloride ( Table 3 ). In total, 135 residents (19.7%) [15.5; 23.9] were re- ceiving at least one drug that was inappropriately dosed TABLE 2 Prevalence of moderate and severe renal impairment (eCCr, Cockcroft–Gault equation) in nursing home residents by age and sex with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) Characteristics Sex Men (n = 170) Women (n = 515) Age in years <70 (n = 70) 70–79 (n = 123) 80–89 (n = 294) ≥90 (n = 198) Total (n = 685)≥60 mL/min (n=249) 57.1% (49.2–65.0) 29.5% (21.8–37.2) 87.1% (77.4–96.9) 68.3% (55.9–80.7) 30.6% (22.9–38.3) 7.1% (3.5–10.7) 36.4% (28.5–44.2)59–30 mL/min (n=330) 36.5% (30.0–42.9) 52.0% (45.6–58.4) 11.4% (2.2–20.6) 29.3% (17.6–41.0) 54.8% (46.9–62.6) 63.1% (55.8–70.5) 48.2% (41.8–54.5)<30 mL/min (n=106) 6.5% (3.2–9.7) 18.4% (14.7–22.2) 1.4% (0.0–4.6) 2.4% (0.0–5.2) 14.6% (9.5–19.7) 29.8% (22.2–37.4) 15.5% (12.4–18.6) 94 Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2016; 113: 92–8 MEDICINE or was contraindicated for their renal level of function. This was associated with higher age, female sex, arterial hypertension, and polypharmacy. Care level had no effect ( Table 4). Discussion Results in the context of the existing literature This cross-sectional study showed that 63.6% of residents had renal insufficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study of renal function in nursing home residents in Germany. Most international studies are from North America and show a very wide range of variation, with values between 22% and 78% (7–12), although some of this variation is due to known differences between the equations used to estimate creatinine clearance (23, 24). The largest study published so far enrolled 9931 residents in 87 homes in Ontario, Canada, and found an eGFR or eCCr <60 mL/min in 35.7% (“modification of diet in renal disease” [MDRD equation]) and 77.5% respectively (Cockcroft–Gault equation, which we used in our study) (11). Similar differences between the estimating equations can also be identified in our study (<60 and <30 mL/min in 63.6% and 15.5% respectively according to Cockcroft–Gault versus 41.5% and 5.5% according to MDRD). This makes clear what a large effect the choice of estimating equation has on the requirement for dose adjustment (25). Where reported, however, all studies, including our own—irrespective of which equation was used—showed renal function reducing with age, and women with lower values than men (8, 10–12). How often nursing home residents receive drugs at inappropriate dosages or that are contraindicated for their renal function, has so far as we know only been in-vestigated in three US studies, none of which included as large a number of different drugs as the present one (18–20). In one study of 1304 nursing home residents, in 11.9% of residents at least one of 21 drugs had not been dose-adjusted (18). In another study, 197 out of 721 residents (27.3%) received at least one of 18 drugs included in the study at an inappropriate dosage (20). The third study included all drugs that were prescribed (55 in total), but only in 90 residents. In that study, 56 residents (62%) received drugs that required dose ad- justment, and in 26 (29%) at least one drug was not dose-adjusted (19). Our finding of around 20% appears comparatively low when one remembers that the larger part of our patient group (90.1%) had drugs prescribed that required adjustment or were contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. Regarding the frequently used drugs, there were some accordances with previous studies (e.g., allopurinol, hydrochloro- thiazide, spironolactone, or gabapentin) (18, 20); other drugs, such as ranitidine, barely appeared in our study (prescribed only three times as scheduled medication). Age and polypharmacy or co-morbidities were associ-ated with non-adjusted medication in both the larger studies (18, 20) and in our own. In the study by Hanlon et al. (18), the odds ratio for female sex was also numerically increased. Strengths and limitations of the present study The present study is based on a dataset of almost 700 nursing home residents prescribed about 4300 drugs as scheduled medication. Nevertheless, it is still a con-venience sample of nursing homes willing to take part in a study of this kind. This means that selection bias cannot be ruled out. The same is true of the reported creatinine values, as some general practitioners, who TABLE 3 Drug prescribing*1 *1 i.e., drugs that potentially were contraindicated or required dose adjustment for use in patients with renal impairment, and how often this was not correctly followed in relation to patient’s actual level of renal function.

For 19.6% of resi-dents, eCCr could not be calculated because no blood samples were taken for the purpose of the study. To do this would have required consent from the residents, which would have led to another selection bias. On the other hand, we were able to include all of the residents in the participating care units—an important point for the validity of the study. In one American study that also relied on existing data, 24% or 32% of creatinine values (depending on the calculation method used) were missing (10). The creatinine values available to us were a median of 185 days old. This does not, however, allow us to conclude with certainty that these values are measured too infrequently. A third of the values were taken from hospital discharge letters: in these cases, more recent values may exist that are unknown to the nursing homes. However, restricting the analysis to residents with values from the preceding year did not alter the prevalence of renal insufficiency. Various equations exist for calculating the GFR, requiring different variables (e.g., cystatin C) and producing different results (8, 21, 23–26). We decided to use the Cockcroft–Gault equation, because this is commonly in routine use in clinical practice (27, 28) and in studies similar to ours (7, 11, 18–20, 23). In ad- dition, it overestimates GFR in older persons to a much lesser extent than do the CKD-EPI and MDRD equations—an important consideration in the question of dose adjustment (28). However, restrictions in drug use in persons with impaired renal function are some-times linked to certain other laboratory values which were not available to us and therefore could not be taken into account in this study. To date, there is no generally accepted, uniform compilation of drugs that are contraindicated or require dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency (18–20, 25, 29). For this reason, we decided to rely on the SPC, since this is what is used by the personnel prescribing and supplying drugs, and is approved by regulatory authorities and regularly revised. It does, however, sometimes contain recommendations that do not reflect current evidence or routine practice; an example would be the contraindication for metformin in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min (29–31), which after the study was concluded was lowered to <45 mL/min. Taking renal artery stenosis into consideration, and with monitoring of creatinine and potassium con-centrations, even ACE inhibitors and sartans are recom-mended for nephroprotection (32, 33). Similarly, cal- cium channel blockers are used in patients with renal insufficiency to reduce blood pressure, and thiazides and related diuretics are used together with loop diu-retics (33). Ultimately, it is up to the treating physician to weigh up risks against benefits, and so it can occasionally happen that even a drug that is contraindi-cated in patients with kidney disease is beneficial. An example is oral substitution with iron(II) sulfate, which, despite being contraindicated in patients with severe kidney disease, is, with regular monitoring, a mainstay of treatment for renal anemia (34). Other limitations of the study are discussed in the eBox . Conclusions Renal insufficiency is common in residents of nursing homes. In this patient group, therefore, creatinine values should be determined at least once a year and, ideally, recorded in the care notes so as to be available to all personnel involved in the patient’s care. This would allow renal function to be taken into account even by, for example, emergency or out-of-hours phys-icians when prescribing. Clearly, this is not regular practice at present. Overall, with about half of the drugs used for sched- uled medication in nursing home residents, caution is TABLE 4 Prevalences and variables associated with drugs administered to nursing home residents that are inappropriately dosed or are contraindicated for the patient’s actual renal function*1 *1 (Odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence interval [95% CI]).

In most of the prescriptions in the present study, this had in fact been taken into account. However, in some cases it was difficult to ascertain whether and which dose ad- justments were needed (e.g., for insulins, opioids, or other analgesics). Sometimes the SPC given by differ-ent manufacturers is even contradictory. This problem of divergent recommendations has also been described in the literature (25, 29). The call for a thorough review and standardization of prescribing information regard-ing the use of drugs in patients with renal insufficien- cy—as formulated in the 2008/2009 action plan for improving drug safety in Germany (35)—therefore needs repeating, with emphasis. Even in the www.dosing.de database set up by Heidelberg University Hospital, dosage recommendations are missing for some active ingredients. Thus, there exists no unified, practical reference source for everyday clinical use where dose adjust- ments to be made in patients with renal insufficiency can be looked up. Given the increasing proportion of older people with multiple morbidities, this is a major problem for drug safety. A variety of approaches to a possible solution exist, which could include the follow-ing: ●Rapid harmonization of summary of product characteristics ●Integration with electronic prescribing aids or apps ●Optimization of www.dosing.de ● Producing a guideline specifically for this pur-pose, as was done in the Netherlands (36).Conflict of interest statement This study was supported financially by KfH-Stiftung Präventivmedizin.

Because of data anonymization, it was not possible to investigate the extent to which transcription errors might have occurred, but we carried out numerous plausibility tests. In addition, no information was available about how frequently drugs were titrated, so we regarded all prescriptions as maintenance doses – and it is likely that in most cases this was in fact the case. It should also be mentioned that due to missing renal values, the sample actually studied was smaller than originally planned. Moreover, all that was tested was whether the drugs prescribed were contraindicated or required dose adjustment in relation to renal function. Other reasons for contraindication may exist in addition to this one but were not included in the present study. The same applies to the question of whether a given drug was, or was still, indicated at all, or whether it would have been lower-risk—irrespective of renal function—to reduce the dosage or discontinue altogether (“deprescribe”) certain drugs in very old residents in nursing homes (1). This topic is under debate especially in relation to the primary and secondary medical prevention of cardiovascular disease (2). For example, it was recently shown that discontinuing statins in patients with limited life expectancy can be a safe option and was associated with better quality of life and with discontinuation of other drugs (3).

Caution is advised when using oxybutynin in patients with impaired renal function, especially those with severe renal insufficiency, as no pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient group. Dose reduction may be necessary. Special care is required in patients with pre-existing renal damage; long-term use of acemetacin mandates regular monitoring of renal function and hemogram. In patients with impaired renal function the dosage of β-acetyldigoxin must be adjusted to renal clearance. In patients with renal impairment the dose must be reduced or the dosing interval extended. For patients with renal insufficiency: In patients with impaired renal function a lower dose may suffice for treatment [...]. No significant change in pharmacokinetic parameters was observed in patients with severe renal impairment. However, limited data are available about the use of agomelatine in patients with severe or moderate renal insufficiency. Caution is therefore advised wh en using it in these patients. In patients with creatinine clearance >35 mL/min, dose adjustment is not required. As very little clinical evidence is availabl e, alendronic acid is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal function with creatinine clearance <35 mL/min. Is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function with creatinine clearance <35 mL/min, due to lack of evidence. In patients with creatinine clearance >35 mL/min, dose adjustment is not required. Without dose adjustment, patients with impaired renal function are at risk of overdose, as allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted via the kidneys. To reduce any possible risk, therefore, reduction of the recommended dosage is indicated. In patients with severe renal impairment, a maximum of 100 mg allopurinol/ per day or single doses of 100 mg at intervals longer than 1 day should be given. In patients with impaired renal function the dosage should always be adjusted for the reduction in renal clearance (determined as creati- nine clearance). In patients with impaired renal function, ambroxol drops should only be used with particular caution (i.e., at longer dosing intervals or in reduced doses). Dose reduction is indicated in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In patients with severely impaired renal function with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, a reduction in subsequent doses is re commen- ded, since accumulation of amoxicillin is to be expected. Patients with a creatinine clearance of 20–30 mL/min should receive t wo thirds of the normal dose, and those with a creatinine clearance <20 mL/min one third of the normal dose. Increasing the dosing interv al with monitoring of the effective serum concentration is a possible option. . In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be reduced in accordance with the severity of the impairment, and should be adjusted for body weight. When two of the following three criteria are met, the dosage should be reduced to 2.5 mg every 12 hours: serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL, age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg. In patients with a creatinine clearance of 15–29 mL/min, the dosage should be reduced to 2.5 mg every 12 hours; in those with a creatinine clearance <15 mL/min, apixaban should not be used. Since atenolol is excreted via the kidneys, in patients with impaired renal function the dosage should be adjusted to renal cle arance: where creatinine clearance values are reduced to 10–30 mL/min (serum creatinine >1.2 <5 mg/dL), the dosage should be reduced to half the standard dosage; for values below <10 mL/min (serum creatinine >5 mg/dL) it should be reduced to a quarter of the stan dard dosage. In patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage of azathioprine should be towards the lower end of the normal range.

In patients with impaired renal function the dosage should be reduced. In the presence of impaired renal function (up to a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min), dose adjustment is usually unnecessary. Clinical monitoring of the patient is however recommended at the beginning of treatment. In patients with severely impaired renal functi on (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) and in patients receiving dialysis, a dose of half a film-coated tablet should not be exceed ed. Bimatoprost has not been investigated in patients with impaired renal function and should therefore be used only with caution in these patients. In patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <20 mL/min), it is recommended that a daily dose of 10 mg is not exceeded. Use in patients with renal impairment: Brimonidine has not been investigated in patients with impaired hepatic or renal functio n. Caution is advised in the treatment of these patients. Patients with impaired renal function usually receive half the normal daily dose, i.e., a quarter of a tablet at night (corresponding to 1.5 mg bromazepam) up to a maximum of one tablet (corresponding to a maximum of 6 mg bromazepam). In patients with impaired renal function, bromhexine drops should only be used with particular caution (i.e., at longer dosing intervals or in reduced doses). Excretion via the kidney can be delayed, as about 30% of the administered dose is excreted via the kidneys. In patients with renal insuf-ficiency, accumulation of buprenorphine metabolites is seen. Particular care is indicated in the treatment of patients with imp aired renal function or severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). Patients with renal impairment: The recommended dose in these patients is 150 mg once a day, as bupriopion and its active metab olites can accumulate in these patients to a greater extent than normal. Should be used with particular care in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min) Calcitriol increases the serum concentration of inorganic phosphate. In patients with hypophosphatemia this is a positive effec t, but for patients with chronic renal insufficiency caution is advised, as here there is a risk of ectopic calcification. As captopril is excreted primarily via the kidneys, in patients with impaired renal function the dosage should be reduced or th e dosing interval extended. In patients with kidney disease a lower dosage is indicated. In patients with markedly impaired renal function the dosage should be reduced. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinin e clearan- ce <20 mL/min) a dose adjustment to one-time administration of 200 mg cefixime per day is recommended. Particular care is advised when using cefixime in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10mL/min). The safety and efficacy of cefuroxime axetil in patients with renal insufficiency have not been shown. Cefuroxime is mainly excreted via the kidneys. When using cefuroxime In patients with markedly impaired renal function, it is recommended that the dose should be reduced in accordance with the delayed renal elimination. Certoparin sodium should only be used with increased caution in patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clea rance <30 mL/min). There are no data to document the efficacy/safety ratio of cetirizine in patients with renal insufficiency. Since cetirizine is mainly excre- ted via the renal route, in cases where no alternative treatment can be used, the dosing intervals must be individualized accor ding to renal function. Patients with impaired renal function usually receive half the recommended dosage. Should only be used with special caution in patients with renal insufficiency. As ciprofloxacin is largely excreted unchanged via the kidneys, in patients with impaired renal function dose adjustment is req uired to avoid increased adverse effects due to accumulation of ciprofloxacin. Clodronate is mainly excreted via the kidneys and should therefore be used with particular caution in patients with renal insuf ficiency. The daily dose should not exceed 1600 mg disodium clodronate continuously. No pharmacokinetic data are available regarding pati ents with renal insufficiency with a creatinine clearance <10 mL/min receiving treatment with oral clodronate. In such patients trea tment should be avoided except in the case of short-term treatment of patients with purely functional renal insufficiency caused by a raised serum calcium concentration. This drug should only be used after careful weighing of risks against benefits and with appropriate caution in patients with se vere hepatic or renal insufficiency. Should only be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. The dosage should always be reduced in these patient s. Dosage in patients with renal insufficiency: The regulation and treatment of hypertension in patients with renal insufficiency through the use of clonidine hydrochloride requires particular care and frequent blood pressure monitoring. For predialysis patients a dosa ge of 0.3 mg clonidine hydrochloride orally per day is usually sufficient. Especially careful medical monitoring is necessary in patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). To date only limited treatment data are available for the use of clopidogrel in patients with renal impairment. Clopidogrel should there -fore be used with care in these patients.

This monitoring is especially important in older patients and those being concurrently treated with cardiac glycosides or diuretics. In patients with hypercalcemia or signs of impaired renal function, the dosage should be reduced or treatment stoppe d. Should only be used with increased caution in patients at increased potential risk of bleeding, e.g., those with severe renal i nsufficiency (creatinine clearance 15–29 mL/min). Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing hyperkalemia (renal insufficiency), as dantrolene has been shown to cause a ri se in serum potassium in animal experiments. Patients with impaired renal function usually receive half the recommended daily dose. Patients with severe hepatic and renal insufficiency may have a reduced digitoxin requirement. In patients with impaired renal function the dosage should be adapted to the patient’s renal clearance. Restriction on use: advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) In patients with impaired hepatic and renal function, the dose should be reduced on an individual basis, usually by 50%. Patients with impaired renal function should receive a reduced dose. To be used with caution in patients with impaired renal fu nction. In patients with severe renal insufficiency the elimination half-life increases from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, although the plasma con centrations were below those of normal probands. As only very small amounts of the drug are excreted unchanged via the kidneys, it does not ap-pear necessary to adjust a one-time dose in patients with renal insufficiency. For repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. The dosing intervals for enalapril should always be extended and/or the dose reduced. Impaired renal function: In patients with mildly or moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min or 30–50 mL/ min, respectively), dose adjustment is not usually required. However, patients should be carefully monitored. In patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), it is recommended to use the following dosages […] In patients with mildly to moderately severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min) no dose adjustment is required. Caution is advised in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min and in dialysis patients. In patients with mild to moderately severe renal insufficiency no dose adjustment is required. Caution is advised in patients w ith severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). Caution: As etilefrine and its conjugates are mainly excreted renally, accumulation of conjugates may potentially occur in pati ents with renal insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics are largely unchanged in patients with mildly to moderately severely impaired renal function. In patients with severely impaired renal function, caution is required. To be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency Like other anticholinergics, should only be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. Patients with renal impairment should be carefully monitored and the dosage reduced if necessary. Patients with impaired renal function should, if treated with transdermal fentanyl patches, be carefully monitored for signs of fentanyl intoxication and the dosage should be reduced if necessary. Patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min): In these patients the maximum initial dose should be 1 00 mg flecainide acetate per day, corresponding to half a tablet twice daily. Particular caution is required when using fluspirilene in patients with renal insufficiency. Dose adjustment may be required in older patients because of age-related reduction in renal function. Patients with renal insufficiency more frequently show hypotensive reactions to haloperidol and should therefore be closely mon itored. Patients with renal insufficiency: These patients may require lower doses than other patient groups to achieve adequate analges ia. In patients with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min the initial dose should be reduced, followed by especially careful dose titration . In patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, extending the dosing interval should also be considered. Dose adjustment: Within the recommended dosage range, the dose should be adjusted to the patient’s reaction to the treatment so as to allow any overdose to be recognized as quickly as possible. This applies particularly in the case of patients with renal ins ufficiency; hydroxyzine is only to be used with particular caution in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. The use of ibandronate in patients with a serum creatinine concentration >200 μmol/L (2.3 mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) <30 mL/min is not recommended because only limited clinical data are available from studies in such patients. In patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine concentration ≤200 μmol/L (2.3 mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) ≥30 mL/min no dose adjustment is required. Should only be used after careful weighing of risks versus benefits and with appropriate caution and monitoring in patients wit h severe renal impairment. Patients with impaired renal function may have a reduced insulin requirement due to reduced insulin metabolism.

Patients with renal damage may have a reduced insulin requirement. Interferon beta should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, and close monitoring should be considered . Caution should be used in administering lamotrigine to patients with impaired renal function. In patients with terminal renal i nsufficiency the initial doses of lamotrigine should be based on the concurrently administered drugs. A reduced maintenance dose may be effe ctive for patients with significantly impaired renal function. In single-dose studies in subjects with end-stage renal failure, plasm a concentra - tions of lamotrigine were not significantly altered. However, caution should nevertheless be exercised in treating patients with renal insufficiency as accumulation of the glucuronide metabolite is to be expected. In older patients with impaired renal function, dose adjustment is recommended [...]. There are no data to document the efficacy/safety ratio in patients with renal insufficiency. Since levocetirizine is mainly ex creted via the kidneys, in cases where no alternative treatment can be used the dosing intervals must be adjusted according to the renal function of the individual. Dose adjustment should be in accordance with the following table […]. As levofloxacin is mainly excreted via the kidneys, the dose should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency the dose should be adjusted with particular care, as an increase in adverse events is to be expected in these patients. Patients with renal insufficiency: Dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal disease. In patients with impaired renal function, the dose should be adjusted on the basis of the creatinine clearance as shown in the following table [...]. Should not be taken by patients with acute renal failure; furthermore, in older patients serum lithium concentrations can reach mildly to- xic levels because of decreasing renal function, resulting in reduced lithium elimination. Serum lithium concentrations should therefore be monitored more frequently in older patients than in standard cases. There are no absolute, general contraindications that apply in every case to patients receiving electrolytes via the gastrointe stinal tract (enteral administration). However, it must always be tested whether any particular cation or anion is contraindicated on the ba sis of the individual’s electrolyte, fluid, and acid–base balance, especially in patients with excretory disorders (renal insufficiency, anuria) and se- vere, disease-related fluid loss (exsiccosis).Patients with renal impairment should only take this drug under medical supervision. Long- term high-dose use should be avoided by such patients. Warnings and precautions: Severe renal impairment In dialysis patients with severe renal insufficiency, the daily dose should not exceed 7.5 mg meloxicam. In patients with mildl y to moderately impaired renal function (e.g., patients with a creatinine clearance of >25 mL/min), no dose reduction is required. In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min), no dose adjustment is required. In patient s with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min) the dose should be 10 mg/day. If this is well tolerated for at least 7 days, the dose may be increased to 20 mg/day in accordance with the standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal im pair- ment (creatinine clearance 5–29 mL/min), the dose should be 10 mg/day. As excretion rates are reduced in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, repeated high doses should be avoided. For short-t erm use only, no dose reduction is necessary. No evidence is available regarding long-term use. The dose should be reduced in patients of ad- vanced age, those in a reduced general state of health, or those with reduced creatinine clearance, as excretion of the metabol ites of metamizole sodium may be delayed. In patients with impaired renal function the dose of metildigoxin should be adjusted according to renal clearance. In patients with impaired renal function, regular monitoring is required in case dose adjustment should become necessary; parti cular caution is required in patients with severe renal damage. Renal insufficiency: Clearance of mirtazapine can be reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinin e clearance <40 mL/min). This should be taken into account when prescribing mirtazapine film-coated tablets for patients in this group. Titrate dose cautiously in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and those in whom slowed gastrointestinal transit is suspe cted. As moxonidine is mainly excreted via the kidneys, caution is advised in patients with impaired renal function. In these patients, careful dose titration is recommended, especially at the start of treatment. The initial dosage should be 0.2 mg/day. If indicated on c linical grounds, and if well tolerated, the daily dose can be increased to a maximum of 0.4 mg in patients with moderately impaired ren al function (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min and <60 mL/min) and a maximum of 0.3 mg in patients with severely impaired renal func tion (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). In patients with renal insufficiency the recommended initial daily dose is 2.5 mg nebivolol. If required, the daily dose can be increased to 5 mg. In patients with impaired renal function a dose reduction is indicated. In patients with impaired renal function it may be necessary to reduce the dosage, as elimination becomes slower as impairment increases. In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), treatment should start at half the normal initial d osage (300 mg/day) and be increased by increments at least 1 week apart until the desired level of effect is reached. Dose increases in pa tients with impaired renal function require careful monitoring. Caution is advised in patients with impaired renal function, especially those with severe renal impairment, as no pharmacokinet ic data are available for these patient groups. Dose reduction might be necessary.

Caution is advised in use in patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal impairment the dose should be reduced or the dosing interval extended. In patients with severe renal ins ufficiency (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min), the dosing interval must be at least 8 hours. Dose reduction or dosing interval extension are required in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min) and in dialysis patients. In patients with renal insufficiency caution is advised, as inadequate data are available regarding the use of pentoxyverine in this patient group. Restrictions on use: Renal impairment In newborns and in patients with impaired renal function excretion is delayed. Dosage in impaired renal function: Up to a creat inine clearance rate of 30–15 mL/min and with a dosing interval of 8 hours, dose reduction is generally unnecessary. In patients with anuria, the dosing interval should be extended to 12 hours. Phenytoin should be used with particular caution in patients with renal impairment. Regular monitoring should be carried out. As piracetam is excreted exclusively via the kidneys, reduced renal function can result in increased plasma concentrations. The daily dose should therefore be determined individually on the basis of renal function. Dose adjustment should be in accordance with t he following table [...]. Excretion of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose scheme is recommended for the start of treatment: In pa-tients with a creatinine clearance rate >50 mL/min no reduction of daily dose or dosing interval is required. In patients with creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 mL/min the initial daily dose of pramipexole should be divided into two separate doses, each consis ting of 0.088 mg of the base (0.125 mg of the salt) (0.176 mg of the base or 0.25 mg of the salt per day). A maximum daily dose of 1.57 mg pramipexole base (2.25 mg salt) should not be exceeded. In patients with a creatinine clearance <20 mL/min the daily dose of pr ami - pexole should be given in a single dose, starting with 0.088 mg of the base (0.125 mg salt). A maximum daily dose of 1.1 mg pra mi - pexole base (1.5 mg salt) should not be exceeded. An initial dose of 10 mg/day is recommended for patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function. The dosage should be adjusted according to lipid response with the patient under medical monitoring. Pregabalin is mainly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. As the rate of pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to the rate of creatinine clearance, dose reduction in patients with impaired renal function needs to be individually adjusted to the creatini ne clearance. Patients with impaired renal function usually receive half the recommended daily dose (normal maximum dose 50–100 mg given in divided doses). In patients with mildly or moderately impaired renal function no dose adjustment is needed, but these patients should be treated with caution. In patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) the maximum daily dose is 30 mg. In patients with severely impaired renal function the elimination of propranolol is reduced, so dose reduction may be required. In patients with a creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min the initial dosage (2.5 mg/day) does not need to be adjusted; the maximum daily dose is 10 mg. In those with a creatinine clearance of 30–60 mL/min the initial dosage (2.5 mg/day) does not need to be adjusted; the maximum daily dose 5 is mg. In those with a creatinine clearance of 10–30 mL/min the initial dose is 1.25 mg/day, and the maximum daily dose is 5 mg. To calculate optimal initial and maintenance dosages in patients with impaired renal function, individualized dose adjustment should be carried out by separate titration of the ramipril and amlodipine components. In patients with impaired renal function no adjustment of the dose of amlodipine is required. In patients with impaired renal function the daily dose of ramipril should be determined on the basis of creatinine clearance: If the creatinine clearance is ≥60 mL/min, no adjustment of the initial dose is necessary; the maximum daily dose is 10 mg [...]. Patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) should generally take a daily dose of 150 mg. Restrictions on use: Patients with renal insufficiency with a tendency to hyperkalemia Patients with impaired renal function are less able to eliminate the active antipsychotic fraction than adults with normal rena l function. Patients with impaired hepatic function have elevated plasma concentrations of the free fraction of risperidone. Irrespective o f indica - tion, initial and subsequent dosages should be halved, and dosages should be increased more slowly in patients with impaired re nal function. Risperidone should be used with caution in these patient groups. Limited clinical data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15–29 mL/min) indicate significantly eleva ted plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban should therefore be used with caution in these patients. The use of rivaroxaban in p atients with a creatinine clearance <15 mL/min is not recommended. In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 m L/ min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min), no dose adjustment is required. According to available pharmacokinetic studies, dose adjustment is normally not required in patients with renal insufficiency. However, in patients with severe renal insufficiency, monitoring of serum concentrations of roxithromycin is advisable and dose reduction or exten- sion of the dosing interval may become necessary. In patients with simultaneous severe renal and hepatic impairment, serum conc en- trations of roxithromycin should be regularly monitored dose adjustment may become necessary. Restrictions on use: Renal impairment: should be used only in rare cases and then only on a small area of skin (max. 10 cm2) and for not longer than 3 days.

In patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily. Saxagliptin is not recommended for use in patients in need of dialy- sis with end-stage renal disease. For patients with moderate renal impairment, usually no dose adjustment is required. In patients with severe renal impairment ( creati - nine clearance <30 mL/min), dosages above 10 mg/day should be considered with care and, if needed, be prescribed with caution. If administration of sitagliptin in combination with another antidiabetic drug is being considered, its conditions for use in p atients with re- nal impairment should be checked. For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min), no dose adjustment is required. For patients with moderate renal impairment ( ≥30 to <50 mL/min), the dose is 50 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose is 25 mg once daily. Particular caution should be exercised when administering sodium chloride solution to patients with impaired renal function or other conditions or therapies associated with sodium retention. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mildly to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min) . Pa- tients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min) should be treated with particular caution and should re- ceive no more than 5 mg once daily. Since repeated administration of sotalol to patients with impaired renal function incurs a risk of accumulation, the dosage sho uld be ad- justed to renal clearance taking into account heart rate (no lower than 50 bpm) and clinical efficacy. It is recommended that p atients with severe renal insufficiency should be given sotalol hydrochloride only with frequent ECG monitoring and monitoring of serum conc entra - tions. It is recommended that in patients whose creatinine clearance is reduced to values of 10–30 mL/min (serum creatinine 2–5 mg/ dL) the dosage should be reduced to half, and at values <10 mL/min (serum creatinine >5 mg/dL) it should be reduced to a quarte r. The solution should be used with caution in patients with hypercalcemia and those with impaired renal function or conditions as sociated with elevated serum vitamin D concentrations. Strontium ranelate is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). In pa tients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 30–70 mL/min) no dose adjustment is necessary. Patients with impaired renal function should be given lower daily doses depending on the severity of impairment. The following guide values should be observed: creatinine clearance 30–60 mL/min, give 50% of the daily dose; creatinine clearance 10–30 mL/min, gi ve 30% of the daily dose; creatinine clearance <10 mL/min, give 20% of the daily dose. In patients with severely impaired renal function the excretion of sulbactam and ampicillin is similarly delayed. The dosing intervals for sultamicillin should be extended in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with conditions that can significantly affect the absorption, metabolism, o r excretion of the drug, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. Tafluprost has not been studied in patients with impaired hepatic/renal function, and therefore this drug should be used with caution in such patients. Particular care is advised in the treatment of patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min), as the use of this drug has not yet been studied in this patient group. In patients with markedly impaired renal function caution is advised; it may be advisable to reduce the dosage. In patients with impaired hepatic or renal function the dose should be titrated slowly; it is possible that lower daily doses w ill be required. Renal impairment: In patients with advanced renal impairment, theophylline metabolites can accumulate. Such patients therefore require smaller doses and dose increments must be carried out particularly carefully. In patients with impaired renal function the dosage should be reduced; if the impairment is severe, tiapride should be disconti nued on medical grounds. [...] has not been investigated in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. For this reason, caution is advised when t reating such patients. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) treatment should start with 2 mg daily, followed by slow titration to achieve the effective dose. Dose increases should be in increments of no more than 2 mg, depending on tolerability and effectiveness. it is advisable to slowly increase the once-daily dose before increasing the frequency of administration. Renal function should be moni - tored as appropriate in these patients. Patients with impaired renal function may need a lower dosage, and for this reason caution is advised when using tizanidine in patients with impaired renal function. Experience in patients with renal impairment is limited and a higher frequency of adverse events has been observed in this pati ent group. Therefore, individual titration with close monitoring of the patient’s condition and renal function is recommended in pa tients with moderate renal impairment. Use of tolperisone is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.. Caution should be exercised when using tolterodine in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min) the recommended dose is 2 mg once daily. In patients with renal impairment (≤ 70 mL/min) tolpiramate should be used with caution, as the plasma and renal clearance of topirama- te are reduced in these patients. Persons with known renal impairment may require a longer time to reach steady state at each d ose. Half of the usual starting and maintenance dose is recommended Because loop diuretics must be actively secreted in the tubules, the dosage must be increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Only limited information is available on dose adjustment in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Urea (topical) Valproate Vildagliptin Xipamide ZuclopenthixolIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 mL/min) the dosing interval should be increased to 12 ho urs. Restrictions on use: patients with impaired renal or hepatic function (follow dosage instructions) In older patients with impaired renal function, appropriate investigation and monitoring before and during treatment are required and the dosage should be adjusted. In particular, the dosage should start low, be increased slowly, and a low maintenance dose should b e chosen. In patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 10–30 mL/min), a daily dose of 20 mg should not be exce eded. Tutofusin should be used only with caution in patients with renal insufficiency with a tendency to hyperkalemia . Contraindications: Should not be used on large areas of skin in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency and hypoproteinemia the increase in serum free valproic acid must be taken into account and the dosage reduced accordingly. In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min) dose adjustment is not required. For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease a dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended. Thiazide diuretics and related drugs are fully effective only in patients with normal or at most mildly impaired renal function (serum creatinine concentration <25 mg/L or <220 μmol/L in an adult). In older patients, the dosage of xipamide should be adjusted in relation to age, weight, and sex and according to serum creatinine concentration. When given to treat edema, dosages of up to 40 mg xipa mide may be required. In patients with more severe impaired renal function the dosage can be increased to up to 80 mg xipamide daily . In- creasing the dosage to >80 mg xipamide per day is not recommended. Particular caution should be exercised in the use of zuclopenthixol in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.",
