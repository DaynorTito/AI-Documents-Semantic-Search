Since then, thepace of drug development for glomerular diseases hasaccelerated, due in large part to rapidly accumulatinginsights into disease pathogenesis from genetic andmolecular studies of af ﬂicted patients. To keep the Glomerular Diseases Guideline as current as possible, KDIGO made a commitment to the nephrology communityto provide periodic updates, based on new developmentsfor each disease. After the 2021 guideline was published,two novel drugs received regulatory approval for themanagement of lupus nephritis, leading to the ﬁrst KDIGO guideline update. Herein, an executive summary of themost important guideline changes from the Lupus Nephritis chapter is provided as a quick reference.

At the sametime, however, the availability of new therapies raisedimportant questions of how best to apply them. After all, thenew therapies are expensive, they do not reduce immuno-suppression but increase exposure, and they require patients historically challenged by medication adherence to take even more drugs on a regular basis. Perhaps the most divisive issuehas been identifying the pro ﬁle of an LN patient who needs more than SOC, and whether belimumab or voclosporinwould be best for that individual. Because belimumab andvoclosporin are poised to signi ﬁcantly change the approach to management of LN, the Lupus Nephritis chapter of theKDIGO 2021 Glomerular Diseases Guideline is the ﬁrst to be updated ( Supplementary Table S1 ;https://kdigo.org/ guidelines/gd/ ). This Executive Summary provides a brief snapshot of the updated guideline, but all readers areencouraged to view the full chapter for detailed discussion anduseful practice points. The most signi ﬁcant update in the LN guideline was the recommendation for the initial treatment of prolifer-ative LN, which now reads: We recommend that patients with active Class III or IV LN, with or without a membranous component, be treated initially with glu-cocorticoids plus any one o ft h ef o l l o w i n g :i .m y c o - phenolic acid analogs (MPAA) ( 1B); or ii. low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide ( 1B); or iii. belimumab and either MPAA or low-dose intravenous cyclophos-phamide ( 1B); or iv.

Each recommended therapeutic regimen has been graded as 1B, meaning astrong recommendation based on moderate certainty ofevidence. The recommendations are based on randomizedcontrolled trials and often more than one randomized controlled trial; however, the results have been down- graded to moderate certainty because of trial limitationssuch as imprecision in estimated effects for many priori-tized outcomes (due to small study size or number ofevents) and methodological li mitations, including lack of blinding in several trials and other risks of bias. The choice of initial therapy is often based on factors that are not related to speci ﬁc disease manifestations. These include, but are not limited to, cost, local availability of thetherapeutics, local healthcare resources (e.g., availability ofinfusion suites), likelihood of adherence, prior immunosup- pression, fertility concerns, and the presence and severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In an idealized healthcareenvironment where cost and accessibility are not factors, itwould be hard to argue against starting treatment with tripleand one of the following optionsKidney biopsy showing Class III/IV ± V lupus nephritis Concomitant thrombotic microangiopathy (Section 10.3.1)Assess activity and chronicity items Chronic Class III/IV ± V lupus nephritis without activityActive Class III/IV ± V lupus nephritis Supportive treatment for chronic kidney diseaseIf concomitant Class V manage as Class V (Section 10.2.4) Glucocorticoids Methylprednisolone i.v. 0.25–0.50 g/d for 1–3 days as appropriate depending on disease severity and rate of progression, then prednisone p.o. at approximately 0.35–1.0 mg/kg/d (not to exceed 80 mg/d) and taper over a few months to maintenance dose (the lower steroid dosing option referring to the reduced-dose regimen in the voclosporin trials)† (Practice Point 10.2.3.1.1) CNI + MPAA Voclosporin 23.7 mg b.i.d. and MPAA in patients with eGFR >45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 Tacrolimus (trough level approximately 5.5 ng/ml [6.8 nmol/l], data mainly from Chinese patients) and reduced-dose MPAA in patients with SCr <3.0 mg/dl (265 µmol/l) as initial and maintenance therapy Consider cyclosporine when voclosporin and tacrolimus are not available (Practice Point 10.2.3.1.4) CNI duration up to 3 years‡Mycophenolic acid analogs (MPAA) for at least 6 months MMF p.o. 1.0–1.5 g b.i.d. or mycophenolic acid sodium 0.72–1.08 g b.i.d.

Nonetheless, many patients may not need the triple-therapy level of immunosuppression, but identifyingsuch patients a priori is not yet possible. For practitioners who want to use triple therapy, the guideline does offer some suggestions, by way of practicepoints, to help decide between belimumab and a CNI. For example, a triple-drug regimen with a CNI may be considered in patients with relatively good kidney function (e.g.,eGFR$45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) who have heavy proteinuria due to podocyte injury, given the known bene ﬁts of CNIs on podocyte structure and function.4Alternatively, a triple-drug regimen with belimumab may be considered in patients whoare at high risk of LN ﬂare or who have advanced CKD that is likely to progress, based on a post hoc analysis of the Ef ﬁcacy and Safety of Belimumab in Patients with Active Lupus Nephritis (BLISS-LN) trial that showed belimumab-treatedpatients had fewer LN ﬂares and a slower decline in kidney function than patients treated with SOC alone. 5This same post hoc analysis suggested that triple therapy with belimumab worked best on a background of SOC with MPAA, and inpatients with non-nephrotic range proteinuria. 5Examples of clinical situations where one drug may be preferred to the other are given in Table 1 . The randomized controlled trials of triple therapy promp- ted a reconsideration of maintenance immunosuppression forproliferative LN. Although MPAA remain the maintenanceimmunosuppressive of choice, the revised LN guideline doesindicate patients treated with SOC plus belimumab or a CNImay remain on triple therapy for an extended time. The pri-mary endpoint of the phase 3 belimumab trial was 2 years, butan open-label extension of an additional 28 weeks showed that belimumab-treated patients had a sustained ef ﬁcacy bene ﬁt with no increase in adverse events. 6Similarly, the endpoint of the phase 3 voclosporin trial was 1 year, but patients doing wellon voclosporin received it for 2 additional years with no declinein kidney function and maintenance of proteinuria reduction. 7 Of note, during this 2-year extension, many patients had a reduction in their voclosporin dose, which could have posi- tively impacted eGFR readings. The immunosuppressive management of pure Class V (membranous) LN remains without de ﬁnitive recommenda- tions, but rather has only suggested practice points, even thoughthe belimumab and voclosporin trials did include such patients.Voclosporin plus SOC was more effective than SOC alone inpatients with Class V LN, but this difference did not quite reach statistical signi ﬁcance, possibly due to a very small number of Class V patients. There were also a small number of Class Vpatients treated with belimumab plus SOC, and compared toSOC alone, they showed no tendency toward a better rate ofremission. Given this, for Class V patients with nephrotic-rangeproteinuria, the guideline continues to suggest managementwith glucocorticoid plus MPAA, CNI, or cyclophosphamide,but highlights the need for trials that focus on Class V LN. Although glucocorticoids are used for the management of LN, there has been considerable effort in the lupus com-munity to reduce cumulative glucocorticoid dosing. Theupdated guideline pointed out that a limited number ofintravenous methylprednisolone pulses given at the start oftreatment may allow reduced dosing and more rapidtapering of glucocorticoids in LN, even in the context ofconventional therapy.Table 1 | Factors to consider when using United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved drugs in lupus nephritis Clinical attributes Voclosporin Belimumab Kidney function Use cautiously if GFR is impaired (e.g., <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2)May be used if GFR is at least 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2; may slow decline of GFRa Kidney histology Use cautiously if widespread sclerotic and/or ﬁbrotic changes are presentNot determined Proteinuria Effective at any level of proteinuria; may be especially effective in patients with severe proteinuria withsigniﬁcant podocyte damageMore effective in patients with proteinuria <3 g/d High risk of disease ﬂare No effect on ﬂare rate May decrease rate of severe ﬂares Background immunosuppressionWas not tested in combination with cyclophosphamide Effective in combination with MMF; uncertain effectiveness in combination withcyclophosphamide Need for parenteral therapy Oral only Intravenous/subcutaneousSigni ﬁcant extrarenal lupus Ef ﬁcacy in extrarenal lupus to be determined Long track record of ef ﬁcacy in extrarenal lupus Safety Add-on therapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events; monitor acute eGFR variations with voclosporinAdd-on therapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events Pregnancy Use not recommended (consider tacrolimus) Use not recommended GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil. aIn patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, the bene ﬁt of any immunosuppression should be carefully weighed against the likelihood of harm.BH Rovin et al.: Executive summary of KDIGO 2024 Lupus Nephritis Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2024) 105, 31–34 33 The updated guideline includes a small but critical new section on CKD progression in LN. Loss of nephron massoccurs with every episode of active LN, putting patientson track toward progressive loss of kidney function, and even kidney failure. Management of patients with LN must include not only immunosuppression for acutetreatment of active LN, but also measures to slow or stopCKD progression. While this section is currently limitedto blood pressure control, renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem blockade, ﬂare prevention, and nephrotoxin avoidance, it is likely to expand in the future as data onLN and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or other new agents such as endothelin-A receptor blockers become available. Finally, there are several additional therapeutics currently being evaluated for the treatment of LN. Thesenovel drugs are in phase 2 and 3 trials. When these trialsare completed, hopefully with success, the KDIGOguideline will be updated again to provide the nephrologycommunity with timely evidence-based recommendations for the management of LN.
