Theguideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treatingpeople with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for whichrecommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-loweringtherapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD.The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoringand targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2),Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD(Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patientswith diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemedcurrent and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidencereview and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guidelinerecommendations are based on systematic reviews ofrelevant studies and appraisal of the quality of theevidence, and the strength of recommendations followedthe “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ”(GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas forwhich additional research is needed are presented.

Received 24 June 2022; accepted 28 June 2022KDIGO executive conclusions www.kidney-international.org 990 Kidney International (2022) 102, 990–999 Practice Guideline1on this topic. The update was motivated by the wealth of high-quality new evidence that has quicklybecome available since the original 2020 guideline was pub-lished and calls from the community to help guide applica- tion of these new data. The short interval between guidelines reﬂects the rapid pace of advances in the management of diabetes and CKD. The scope of the 2022 guideline is unchanged from 2020. The guideline addresses both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type2 diabetes (T2D), all stages of CKD (de ﬁned as persistent albuminuria [albumin –creatinine ratio {ACR} $30 mg/g {$3 mg/mmol}], persistently reduced estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2], or both), patients with a kidney transplant, and patients treated withhemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Lifestyle, pharmacologic,self-care, and systems interventions were all evaluated. Theguideline focuses on clinical management questions that canbe addressed with high-quality scienti ﬁc evidence, speci ﬁcally, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated clinicallyrelevant outcomes. The Evidence Review Team (ERT) ﬁrst updated the systematic literature search for each topic covered by the2020 guideline. The Work Group reviewed the ERT sum-mary of new studies and judged by topic whether there wassufﬁcient new evidence to conduct a full quantitative reassessment with reconsideration of recommendations.For these topics, the ERT updated the evidence synthesis( b o t hn a r r a t i v ea n dq u a n t i t a t i v e )a n dr e a s s e s s e dt h e g r a d i n gf o rt h eq u a l i t yo ft h ee v i d e n c eb a s e ,a n dt h eW o r k Group revised the corresponding guideline chaptersaccordingly. Based on this updated review, Chapters 1 (Comprehensive care) and 4 (Glucose-lowering therapies) were substantiallyrevised. These include full revisions for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and the devel- opment of a new section on mineralocorticoid receptor an- tagonists (MRA). Chapters 2 (Glycemic monitoring andtargets in patients with diabetes and CKD), 3 (Lifestyle in-terventions in patients with diabetes and CKD), and 5 (Ap-proaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD)were deemed current, and no changes were made to recom-mendations or practice points. For a detailed list of thechanges between the 2020 and 2022 guidelines, please see Supplementary Table S1 . Recommendations were graded using the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-tion”(GRADE) criteria. 2In addition, ungraded practice points were issued to provide guidance and context forimplementation of recommendations or when expertguidance was deemed necessary, but available evidence wasinsuf ﬁcient for a formal recommendation. Comprehensive care People with diabetes and CKD are at high risk for progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular events (myocardialinfarction [MI], stroke, ischemia, arrhythmia, and heart failure), as well as acute diabetes-related complications (hy-poglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) and other long-termdiabetes complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, foot ulcers, and amputations). Like the 2020 guideline, the 2022 guideline advocates a comprehensive approach to assess the multiplerisk factors for these adverse outcomes and partnership withpatients and healthcare systems to implement evidence-basedtherapies. Such multifactorial care has been shown to improveoutcomes in RCTs. 3–6 A pyramid graphic that summarizes components of comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD has been updated to re ﬂect new recommendations ( Figure 1 ). The graphic has been rearranged to re ﬂect that drugs proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes arepart of a foundation of care that, along with lifestyle, aimsto improve clinical outcomes irrespective of effects on in-termediate targets. For example, SGLT2i are ﬁrst-line ther- apy for people with T2D and CKD regardless of glycemia,but SGLT2i also lower blood glucose. Therefore, SGLT2i are considered a foundation of pharmacologic therapy for T2D and CKD, with additional agents layered on top of SGLT2iand metformin as needed to attain individualized glycemictargets ( Figure 2 ). When designing patient-centered treatment regimens, we suggest that patients and healthcare professionals build fromthe base of the pyramid upward. Repeat evaluations at regularintervals are needed to ensure that interventions are titrated appropriately and combinations of interventions are pre- scribed to optimize care. In partnership with the AmericanDiabetes Association (ADA), a corresponding ﬂow diagram was also generated to demonstrate this approach in a top-down con ﬁguration ( Figure 3 ). The ﬂow diagram shows that multiple aspects of care should be addressed in parallel,advanced over time through longitudinal evaluations, andrefreshed through repeat risk assessments. Regular screening for CKD with assessment of ACR and eGFR was stressed as being a critical prerequisite for correct diagnosis of CKD andimplementation of interventions. 7 SGLT-2 inhibitors Seven large clinical outcomes trials of SGLT2i were pub-lished between release of the 2020 guideline and thedevelopment of the 2022 guideline update. 8–14These trials provide high-quality data on the bene ﬁts and harms of this class of medications, as detailed in the full guidelinedocument, and reinforce the strong recommendationoffered in 2020 that patients with T2D and CKD be treatedwith an SGLT2i across albuminuria and most eGFR cate-gories (Grade 1A). An important modi ﬁcation is the lower eGFR threshold at which SGLT2i should be initiated. The 2022 guideline advocates initiating an SGLT2i for patients with T2D and CKD who have an eGFR$20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(Figures 2 and3), as opposed to$30 ml/min per 1.73 m2in the 2020 guideline. Patients with T2D, CKD, and eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2have now beenP Rossing et al.: KDIGO 2022 guideline on diabetes in CKD KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2022) 102, 990–999 991 extensively studied in RCTs of SGLT2i. The Dapagli ﬂozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) and Effect of Sotagli ﬂozin on Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and ModerateRenal Impairment Who Are at Cardiovascular Risk (SCORED)trials enrolled CKD patients with eGFR down to as low as25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.9,12The Empagli ﬂozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced EjectionFraction (EMPEROR-Reduced) and The Empagli ﬂozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved) trials, although notconducted exclusively in CKD populations, enrolled participantswith eGFR as low as 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.8,14The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagli ﬂozin (EMPA-KID- NEY), which enrolled an exclusive CKD population and wasstopped early for bene ﬁt, also enrolled participants with eGFR$20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.15Subgroup analyses of individualtrials and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated kidney and cardiovascular bene ﬁts across eGFR categories, including participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2and participants without albuminuria.16,17Several trial protocols speci ﬁed continuation of the study drug if eGFR fell below the eGFRthreshold required for eligibility; observed bene ﬁts with this approach further support use of SGLT2i at lower eGFR and werethe basis for a revised practice point (Practice Point 1.3.6) advo-cating that SGLT2i be continued as long as tolerated, even if eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, until kidney replacement therapy is initiated. The 2022 guideline more ﬁrmly emphasizes that SGLT2i should be used for patients with T2D and CKD, regardless ofglycemia. Multiple SGLT2i trials included subsets of participantswithout diabetes, who appear to have derived similar bene ﬁts as those with T2D, 8,14,18and increasing evidence supports non- glycemic mechanisms of kidney and cardiovascular bene ﬁts.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be treated with a comprehensive approach to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. This approach should include a foundation of lifestyle modi ﬁcation and self-management for all patients, upon which are layered ﬁrst-line drug therapies according to clinical characteristics (in parentheses), additional drugs with proven kidney and heart protection as guided by assessments of residual risk, and additional interventions as needed tofurther control risk factors. Glycemic control is based on insulin for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and a combination of metformin and sodium-glucosecotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin may be given when estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, and SGLT2i should be initiated when eGFR is $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2and continued, as tolerated, until dialysis or transplantation is initiated. Renin –angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition is recommended for patients with albuminuria and hypertension (HTN). A statin is recommended for all patients with T1D or T2D and CKD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are preferred glucose-lowering drugs for people with T2D if SGLT2i and metformin are insuf ﬁcient to meet glycemic targets or if they are unable to use SGLT2i or metformin. A nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) can be added to ﬁrst-line therapy for patients with T2D and high residual risks of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events, as evidenced by persistent albuminuria ( >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]). Aspirin generally should be used lifelong for secondary prevention among those with established cardiovascular disease and may be considered for primary prevention among patients with high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).KDIGO executive conclusions P Rossing et al.: KDIGO 2022 guideline on diabetes in CKD 992 Kidney International (2022) 102, 990–999 SGLT2i have been demonstrated to be effective and safe at any level of glycemic control and with or without concomitant use ofrenin –a n g i o t e n s i ns y s t e mi n h i b i t o r s( R A S i )o rm e t f o r m i n .T o reinforce these principles, SGLT2i were moved from Chapter 4 (Glucose-lowering therapies) to Chapter 1 (Comprehensive care).Combinations of SGLT2i with other drugs are addressed inpractice points and in Chapter 4 ( Table 1 andFigure 4 19). Unfortunately, data remain insuf ﬁcient to make a recom- mendation on SGLT2i use for people with T1D and CKD,kidney transplant recipients, or patients treated with dialysis.These populations remain excluded from the SGLT2i recommendation, and the need for rigorous studies in these populations is highlighted in research recommendations. GLP-1 receptor agonists One new trial (Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovascular Out-comes [AMPLITUDE-O] 20) strengthened evidence for cardio- vascular bene ﬁts of GLP-1 RA and bolstered the hypothesis that GLP-1 RA may also improve kidney outcomes. Proven cardio- vascular bene ﬁts of GLP-1 RA have been demonstrated across strata of eGFR and serve as the major rationale for recommendingGLP-1 RA as the preferred glucose-lowering drug for people withT 2 Da n dC K Dw h ow e r en o ta t t a i n i n gg l y c e m i cg o a l sd e s p i t eu s eof SGLT2i and metformin (or who were unable to use SGLT2iand/or metformin). Therefore, GLP-1 RA remain the recom-mended second-line drug class for glucose-lowering in T2D andCKD ( Figures 2 and3). The quality of supporting evidence for the use of GLP-1 RA continues to be rated as B because dedicated trials inpopulations with CKD have not yet been published (indi-rectness). The recommendation has a Level 1 strength ofrecommendation because the Work Group judged that mostpeople with T2D and CKD who need an additional drugtherapy to control blood glucose (after lifestyle modi ﬁcation and use of SGLT2i and metformin, if appropriate and toler- ated) would choose a GLP-1 RA over other glucose-lowering drugs. For this particular application, the demonstrated car-diovascular and possible kidney bene ﬁts of GLP-1 RA offer clear bene ﬁts to alternative drugs. The recommendation doesnot call for use of GLP-1 RA among patients with T2D who have achieved their target glycemic control with lifestyle,SGLT2i, and metformin, based on currently available data on GLP-1 RA risks and bene ﬁts. GLP-1 RA were also demonstrated to effectively reduce weight. 21–24Weight loss is an important goal of some obese patients with CKD, including those who want to lose weightto facilitate a kidney transplant. The Work Group foundinsufﬁcient evidence to recommend use of GLP-1 RA for weight loss among people with diabetes and CKD speci ﬁcally, but issued a new practice point highlighting the potential advantages of this approach ( Table 1 ). Non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists Two large clinical trials (Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease[FIDELIO-DKD] 25and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovas- cular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease[FIGARO-DKD] 26) and a pre-speci ﬁed individual-level combined analysis of these 2 trials (The FInerenone in chronic kiDney diseasE and type 2 diabetes: CombinedFIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD Trial programme analYsis[FIDELITY] 27) evaluated the bene ﬁts and risks of a new non- steroidal MRA (ns-MRA), ﬁnerenone. FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD each enrolled people with T2D treated withthe maximum-tolerated dose of RASi who had residualalbuminuria (ACR $30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol]) and a non- elevated serum potassium ( <4.8 mEq/l at screening). Together, 67% had severe albuminuria (ACR $300 mg/g [$30 mg/mmol]), and mean eGFR was 57.6 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.27Participants were randomly assigned to ﬁnerenone or placebo. In FIDELIO-DKD, ﬁnerenone signi ﬁcantly reduced the incidence of both the primary composite kidney outcome(kidney failure, sustained decrease $40% in eGFR, or death from kidney causes; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82, 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.73 –0.93) and the secondary composite car- diovascular outcome (death from cardiovascular causes,nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heartGLP-1 receptor agonist (preferred) DPP-4 inhibitor Insulin TZD Sulfonylurea Alpha-glucosidase inhibitorFirst-line therapyLifestyle therapy Additional drug therapy as needed for glycemic control• Guided by patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR, and cost • Includes patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or treated with dialysis • See Figure 25 in full guideline Physical activity Nutrition Weight loss SGLT2 inhibitor Metformin + Discontinue Discontinue Reduce dose Discontinue Do not initiate eGFR < 45eGFR < 30Dialysis Dialysis eGFR < 20 Figure 2 | Treatment algorithm for selecting glucose-lowering drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Hyperkalemia was more common with ﬁnerenone compared with placebo (14% vs. 6.9%), with a small cumulative incidence of permanent discontinuation of study drug for hyperkalemia (1.7% vs. 0.6%) and no deaths due to hyperkalemia over 3 years. 27 Esaxerenone, another ns-MRA, has also been shown to lower urinary albumin excretion. However, the long-termkidney and cardiovascular bene ﬁts of esaxerenone have not been established, and regulatory approval for esaxerenone is,so far, limited to treatment of hypertension in Japan. 28,29 The Work Group judged that the majority of well- informed patients with T2D who had persistent albumin-uria (ACR >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]) and non-elevated serum potassium despite maximal tolerated dose of RASi would choose to receive an ns-MRA with proven kidney and cardiovascular protective bene ﬁts (Table 1 ). This recom- mendation is based on the high-quality evidence fromFIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD (Grade A, summarizedabove) that ﬁnerenone slows progression of CKD and reduces risks of cardiovascular events in this population. 25,26None- theless, some patients will choose not to be treated with anns-MRA because of lack of de ﬁnitive data on bene ﬁts and risks when an ns-MRA is added to an SGLT2i (which is part of the current standard of care), modest representation ofpatients with certain relevant characteristics (e.g., moderatealbuminuria) in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials, tnemeganam thgieW teid yhtlaeH Smoking cessation Physical activity Metformin (if eGFR ≥30)SGLT2i (Initiate eGFR ≥20; continue until dialysis or transplant)RAS inhibitor at maximum tolerated dose (if HTN*)Moderate- or high-intensity statin GLP-1 RA if needed to achieve individualized glycemic targetNonsteroidal MRA† if ACR ≥30 mg/g [≥3 mg/mmol] and normal potassiumDihydropyridine CCB and/or diuretic* if needed to achieve individualized BP targetAntiplatelet agent for clinical ASCVDLifestyle First-line drug therapy Additional risk-based therapy Other glucose-lowering drugs if needed to achieve individualized glycemic targetSteroidal MRA if needed for resistant hypertension if eGFR ≥45Ezetimibe, PCSK9i, or icosapent ethyl if indicated based on ASCVD risk and lipidsRegular risk factor reassessment (every 3–6 months) T2D only All patients (T1D and T2D)Regular reassessment ofglycemia, albuminuria,BP, CVD risk, and lipids Figure 3 | Holistic approach for improving outcomes in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. *Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) should be ﬁrst-line therapy for hypertension (HTN) when albuminuria is present, otherwise dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) or diuretic can also be considered; all 3 classes are often needed to attainblood pressure (BP) targets. †Finerenone is currently the only nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) with proven clinical kidney and cardiovascular bene ﬁts.

These limitationsled to a strength of recommendation of Level 2 ( “we sug- gest”), as discussed in detail in the full guideline. This guideline issues a strong recommendation for use of an SGLT2i in the treatment of people with T2D and CKD,positioning SGLT2i as ﬁrst-line drug therapy to prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular events, regardless of glycemia (Figures 1 –3). This recommendation is based on 11 published clinical trials that provide strong evidence of ef ﬁcacy and applies to most patients with T2D and CKD for whom an ns-MRA is also suggested. SGLT2i were not standard of carewhen the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials were initiated. However, 877 participants were using an SGLT2i atbaseline, and the cardiovascular effects of ﬁnerenone, compared with placebo, appeared to be at least as bene ﬁcial among people using, versus not using, an SGLT2i. 27It is also possible that SGLT2i may reduce the risk of hyperkalemia forpatients treated concomitantly with an RASi and anns-MRA. 30,31These data, combined with complementary mechanisms of action, suggest that the bene ﬁts of SGLT2i and ﬁnerenone may be additive. Therefore, patients with T2D and CKD who are treated with both an RASi and an SGLT2i andmeet criteria for ﬁnerenone (including residual albuminuria and non-elevated serum potassium) are appropriateTable 1 | Select recommendations and practice points from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Comprehensive care Practice Point 1.1.1: Patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be treated with a comprehensive strategy to reduce risks of kidn ey disease progression and cardiovascular disease. SGLT2 inhibitors Recommendation 1.3.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 1.3.1: The recommendation for SGLT2i is for kidney and cardiovascular protection and SGLT2i have been shown to have safety and bene ﬁt in CKD patients, even for those without T2D. Thus, if patients are already being treated with other glucose-lowering agents, an SGLT2i can be added tothe current treatment regimen. Practice Point 1.3.2: The choice of an SGLT2i should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts and take eGFR into account. Practice Point 1.3.3: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when patients may be at greater risk for ketosis). Practice Point 1.3.4: If a patient is at risk for hypovolemia, consider decreasing thiazide or loop diuretic dosages before commencement of SGLT2i treatment, advise patients about symptoms of volume depletion and low blood pressure, and follow up on volume status after drug initiation. Practice Point 1.3.5: A reversible decrease in the eGFR with commencement of SGLT2i treatment may occur and is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Practice Point 1.3.6: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, unless it is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated. Practice Point 1.3.7: SGLT2i have not been adequately studied in kidney transplant recipients, who may bene ﬁt from SGLT2i treatment, but are immunosuppressed and potentially at increased risk for infections; therefore, the recommendation to use SGLT2i does not apply to kidney transplantrecipients (see Recommendation 1.3.1). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for patients with T2D, an eGFR ‡25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( ‡30 mg/g [ ‡3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A). Practice Point 1.4.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for patients with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, a s demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies. Practice Point 1.4.2. A nonsteroidal MRA can be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD.Practice Point 1.4.3. To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select patients with consistently normal serum potassium concentration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA. Practice Point 1.4.4. The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts. Practice Point 1.4.5. A steroidal MRA should be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly among patients with a low GFR. GLP-1 receptor agonists Recommendation 4.2.1: In patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i treatment, or who are unable to use those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B). Practice Point 4.2.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene ﬁts. Practice Point 4.2.2: To minimize gastrointestinal side effects, start with a low dose of GLP-1 RA, and titrate up slowly. Practice Point 4.2.3: GLP-1 RA should not be used in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.Practice Point 4.2.4: The risk of hypoglycemia is generally low with GLP-1 RA when used alone, but risk is increased when GLP-1 RA is used concomitantly with other medications such as sulfonylureas or insulin. The doses of sulfonylurea and/or insulin may need to be reduced. Practice Point 4.2.5. GLP-1 RA may be preferentially used in patients with obesity, T2D, and CKD to promote intentional weight loss. eGFR, estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate; GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist(s); RASi, renin –angiotensin system inhibitor(s); SGLT2i, sodium –glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.P Rossing et al.: KDIGO 2022 guideline on diabetes in CKD KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2022) 102, 990–999 995 candidates for treatment with ﬁnerenone. In addition, ﬁner- enone may be added to an RASi alone for patients who do nottolerate or are not candidates for an SGLT2i. 25 To mitigate hyperkalemia risk, the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials restricted eligibility to patients with non-elevated serum potassium concentration (after maxi-mizing RASi) and implemented a standardized potassium-monitoring protocol. Clinicians should follow a similarapproach to selecting, monitoring, and treating patients withns-MRA therapy, summarized in Figure 5 , to increase the likelihood that the acceptable adverse event pro ﬁle seen in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials is maintained when applied to clinical practice. Steroidal MRA, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have only been rigorously evaluated in long-term clinicaloutcomes trials in the setting of heart failure. Steroidal MRAare useful for management of heart failure as well as primaryhyperaldosteronism and resistant hypertension. 32,33When a patient is treated with neither a steroidal MRA nor an ns-MRAbut has indications for both (e.g., T2D with heart failure and albuminuria on ﬁrst-line therapies), the most clinically pressing indication should drive selection of the MRA.Currently, an ns-MRA cannot be a replacement for steroidalMRA for the indications of heart failure and hyper-aldosteronism. Combining a steroidal MRA and ns-MRA islikely to increase adverse effects and should not be done.Conclusions New therapies and high-quality clinical trials have creatednew opportunities for better treatment of people with dia-betes and CKD. This welcome proliferation of options canalso cause confusion or controversy that creates a barrier toimplementation. One important goal of the updated KDIGO2022 guideline is to provide a clear, practical, and evidence- based approach to treatment that is useful for a wide vari- ety of patients and healthcare professionals. As always, it isnecessary to individualize care for speci ﬁc patients. The KDIGO 2022 guideline advocates a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventionsandﬁrst-line pharmacotherapy that has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. Added to this are therapies toreduce the risk of adverse outcomes and control known risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, such as blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids. Although otherguidelines have suggested viewing multifactorial therapy as“pillars ”of care, 34–36the layered approach acknowledges a preference for starting new treatments one at a time andreassessing response and residual risk during re ﬁnement of the treatment regimen. In particular, to maximize the chancesthat combination treatments can be tolerated, it is logical to start medications that affect intrarenal hemodynamics serially (e.g., RASi, SGLT2i, MRA, diuretics, and other antihyper-tensive medications).

With new therapies that can reduce progression of CKD and diminish the burden of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, it is time for those managing diabetes and CKD to focus on preserving kidney function and maintaining well-beingrather than on replacing kidney function. 37The bene ﬁcial ef- fects of SGLT2i, ns-MRA, and GLP-1 RA on CKD and car-diovascular disease provide an opportunity to achieve thesegoals and save millions of lives, but will only bene ﬁt people with diabetes and CKD if the use of these drugs is implementedwidely and in a timely manner. Successful implementation will necessarily involve collective efforts from all stakeholders, including patients, primary care physicians, specialists such asendocrinologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists, as well ashealthcare systems, payors, regulators, and life science in-dustries. 38It will require concerted action to ensure early detection of CKD with regular screening, education ofhealthcare professionals regarding multidisciplinary in-terventions, and empowerment of patients to ensure engage- ment and self-care. 39Implementation requires community outreach efforts to make care accessible and equitable, and it isimperative that patient preferences and priorities shapeimplementation strategies. The cost of new therapies is a barrier to implementation. 40 Avoiding or delaying costly kidney replacement therapy maymake it cost-effective to implement the new therapies, 41–43but more data are needed to support this possibility. Creating a convincing case for use of CKD therapies as part of a healthcare system strategy for value-based care is essential to translatingtheoretical cost-effectiveness analyses into reality. This chal-lenge is universal, spanning healthcare globally. This guidelinesuggests that policymakers and institutional decision-makersimplement team-based, integrated care that is focused on riskevaluation and patient empowerment to provide comprehen-sive care in patients with diabetes and CKD. 38 Multiple professional societies issue recommendations for care of people with diabetes, CKD, or both,44and the existence of multiple guidelines can create the appearance of inconsistency. Toaddress this concern, concurrent with development of the 2022guideline, KDIGO partnered with the ADA, which publishes the inﬂuential annual Standards of Care for diabetes treatment, to issue a consensus report on the diagnosis and management ofdiabetes and CKD. The KDIGO-ADA consensus report demon-strates broad consistencies across evidence-based recommenda- tions from the 2 professional societies and emphasizes high- priority interventions. 7In addition, the consensus report ad- dresses aspects of CKD prevention, screening, and diagnosis,which are important clinical topics not explicitly covered in theKDIGO diabetes and CKD guideline. Diabetes and CKD continue to be active areas of research, and further advances in diagnosis and treatment are expected.KDIGO will continue to update the diabetes and CKD guideline when major advances occur. At this time, the KDIGO 2022 guideline outlines the state-of-the-art treatmentfor diabetes and CKD. Implementation of evidence-basedtreatments is now needed to improve the lives of peopleliving with diabetes and CKD.
