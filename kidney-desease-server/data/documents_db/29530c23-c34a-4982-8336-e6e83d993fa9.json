The sooner you know you have kidney disease, the better. The steps you take to protect your kidneys from damage also may help prevent heart disease—and improve your health overall. Making these changes when you have no symptoms may be hard, but it’s worthwhile. Ten ways to manage kidney disease 1. Control your blood pressure 2. Meet your blood glucose goal if you have diabetes 3. Work with your health care team to monitor your kidney health 4. Take medicines as prescribed 5. Work with a dietitian to develop a meal plan 6. Make physical activity part of your routine 7. Aim for a healthy weight 8. Get enough sleep 9. Stop smoking 10. Find healthy ways to cope with stress and depression Control your blood pressure The most important step you can take to treat kidney disease is to control your blood pressure. High blood pressure can damage your kidneys. You can protect your kidneys by keeping your blood pressure at or less than the goal set by your health care provider. For most people, the blood pressure goal is less than 140/90 mm Hg. Work with your health care provider to develop a plan to meet your blood pressure goals. Steps you can take to meet your blood pressure goals may include eating heart-healthy and low-sodium meals, quitting smoking, being active, getting enough sleep, and taking your medicines as prescribed.28/9/25, 14:18 Managing Chronic Kidney Disease - NIDDK https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/managing 1/8 Meet your blood glucose goal if you have diabetes To reach your blood glucose goal, check your blood glucose level regularly. Use the results to guide decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines. Ask your health care provider how often you should check your blood glucose level. Your health care provider will also test your A1C. The A1C is a blood test that measures your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This test is different from the blood glucose checks you do regularly. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months. Stay close to your daily blood glucose numbers to help you meet your A1C goal. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. Ask your health care provider what your goal should be. Reaching your goal numbers will help you protect your kidneys. Learn more about how to manage diabetes. Work with your health care team to monitor your kidney health The tests that health care providers use to test for kidney disease can also be used to track changes to kidney function and damage.

If so, what are they? Bring a friend or relative with you for support A trusted friend or family member can take notes, ask questions you may not have thought of, offer support, and help remember what the provider said during the visit. Talk ahead of time about what you want to get out of the visit and the role you would like your friend or relative to play. Who is part of my health care team? The following health care providers may be part of the health care team involved in your treatment: Primary care provider. Your primary care provider (PCP)—doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant—is the person you see for routine medical visits. Your PCP may monitor your kidney health and help you manage your diabetes and high blood pressure. A PCP also prescribes medicines and may refer you to specialists. Nurse. A nurse may help with your treatment and teach you about monitoring and treating kidney disease, as well as managing your health conditions. Some nurses specialize in kidney disease. Registered dietitian. A registered dietitian is a food and nutrition expert who helps people create a healthy eating plan when they have a health condition such as kidney disease. Dietitians can help you by creating an eating plan based on how your kidneys are doing. “Renal dietitians” often work in dialysis centers and are specially trained to work with people with kidney failure. Diabetes educator. A diabetes educator teaches people with diabetes how to manage their disease and handle diabetes-related problems. Pharmacist. A pharmacist educates you about your medicines and fills your prescriptions. An important job for the pharmacist is to review all of your medicines, including over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and supplements, to avoid unsafe combinations and side effects. Social worker. When you are close to needing dialysis, you may have a chance to meet with a social worker. A dialysis social worker helps people and their families deal with the life changes and costs that come with having kidney disease and kidney failure. A dialysis social worker also can help people with kidney failure apply for help to cover treatment costs. Nephrologist. A nephrologist is a doctor who is a kidney specialist. Your PCP may refer you to a nephrologist if you have a complicated case of kidney disease, your kidney disease is quickly getting worse, or your kidney disease is advanced. 28/9/25, 14:18 Managing Chronic Kidney Disease - NIDDK https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/managing 4/8 Take medicines as prescribed Many people with CKD take medicines prescribed to lower blood pressure, control blood glucose, and lower cholesterol. Two types of blood pressure medicines, ACE inhibitors and ARBs, may slow kidney disease and delay kidney failure, even in people who don’t have high blood pressure. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan. Many people need to take two or more medicines for their blood pressure. You may also need to take a diuretic, sometimes called a water pill. The aim is to meet your blood pressure goal. These medicines may work better if you limit your salt intake. Know that your medicines may change over time Your health care provider may change your medicines as your kidney disease gets worse. Your kidneys don’t filter as well as they did in the past, and this can cause an unsafe buildup of medicines in your blood. Some medicines can also harm your kidneys. As a result, your provider may tell you to take a medicine less often or take a smaller dose stop taking a medicine or switch to a different one Your pharmacist and health care provider need to know about all the medicines you take, including OTC medicines, vitamins, and supplements. Be careful about the over-the-counter medicines you take If you take OTC or prescription medicines for headaches, pain, fever, or colds, you may be taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include commonly used pain relievers and cold medicines that can damage your kidneys and lead to acute kidney injury, especially in those with kidney disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Ibuprofen and naproxen are NSAIDs. NSAIDs are sold under many different brand names, so ask your pharmacist or health care provider if the medicines you take are safe to use.
