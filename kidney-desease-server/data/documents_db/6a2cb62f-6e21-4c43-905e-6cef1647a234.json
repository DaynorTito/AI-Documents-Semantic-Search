Obesity, as part of the metabolic syndrome adds to the morbidity an d mortality. The incidence of diabetes and hypertension, two primary etiologica l factors for chronic re nal failure, is significantly higher with obesity. We report a case with morbid obesity whose renal function was stabilized with aggressive management of his obesity. Case report: A 43-year old morbidly obese Caucasian ma le was referred for evaluation of his chronic renal failure. He had been hypertensive with well controlled blood pressure with a body mass index of 46 and a baseline se rum creatinine of 4.3 mg/dl (estim ated glomerular filtration rate of 16 ml/min). He had failed all conservative attempts at weight reduction and hence was referred for a gastric by-pass surgery. Following the bariat ric surgery he had approximately 90 lbs. weight loss over 8-months and his serum cr eatinine stabilized to 4.0 mg/dl. Conclusion: Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for renal failure. Targeting obesity is beneficial not only for bette r control of hypertension and diabetes, but also possibly helps stabilization of chronic kidney failure. Background Obesity is a major health problem in the western world. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. adults are overweight (BMI > 25) and of these one-half are obese (BMI >30) [1]. Obes-ity is not only associated with increase in morbidity, mor-tality and reduction in life expectancy [2], but also leadsto increase in the incidence of diabetes [3], hypertension[4], dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease [5]. Both diabetes and hypertension together account for approxi- mately 70% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Approximately 300,000 adult deaths in the United States each year are attributable to unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity or sedentary behavior, with obese indi- viduals having a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of deathfrom all causes; most of the increased risk is due to cardi-ovascular causes [6,7]. Obesity has also resulted in anincrease in the cluster of disorders often referred to as the\"metabolic syndrome\". Although kidney disease has not yet been recognized as a major component of this meta- bolic syndrome, accumulating evidence suggests that evenin non-diabetic obese patients, there is some degree ofrenal dysfunction that can lead to more serious injury toPublished: 15 June 2005 BMC Nephrology 2005, 6:7 doi:10.1186/1471-2369-6-7Received: 14 January 2005 Accepted: 15 June 2005 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/6/7 © 2005 Agnani et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

We report a case that illustrates the stabilization of renal function with obesity directed therapy. Case Report A 43-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the nephrol-ogy clinic at Overton Brooks VAMC by his primary carepractitioner, in November of 2002 for management of hischronic kidney disease. He was asymptomatic. His BP waswell controlled at 115/83 mmHg. He was morbidly obesewith a body mass index (BMI) of 46, chronic kidney dis- ease stage 4 (MDRD GFR of 16 ml/min), non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronaryartery disease status post stent placement and hyperlipi-demia. His medications included nifedipine, fosinopril,atenolol, rosiglitazone, furosemide, simvastatin, aspirin,glyburide and calcium carbonate. Laboratory results:Serum creatinine 4.3 mg/dl, BUN 54 mg/dl, normal elec- trolytes, serum calcium 8.8 mg/dl, serum phosphorus 4.9 mg/dl, random urine protein 292 mg/dl, random urinecreatinine 49 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine ratio of 5.9,hemoglobin A1c 7% and hemoglobin 13.9 g/dl. Patientwas educated about the course and prognosis of his kid-ney disease and advised diet and exercise for weight loss. He was referred for arterial-venous fistula placement for providing renal replacement therapy in future. Over thenext 6 months the patient failed all conservative methodsof weight loss including the use of orlistat. His morbidobesity posed a major contraindication for enrolling himfor kidney transplantation. He agreed to the surgical ther- apy option for treating his obesity. He was referred for bar- iatric surgery in June 2003. After the bariatric surgery in September 2003, he had lost 60 pounds at 6 months (BMI 37). He was able to discon-tinue all his oral hypoglycemic agents maintaining a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2% and required only one anti- hypertensive medication to achieve the recommended tar-get blood pressure reading. His BUN and creatinine hasremained at 22 mg/dl and 4.6 mg/dl respectively. Thepatient is being followed at regular intervals and over thecourse of the next eight months has lost an additional 30pounds (BMI 32), a total weight loss of 90 pounds since the bariatric surgery. His serum creatinine has remained stable at 4 mg/dl, BUN 37 mg/dl, random urinary protein99 mg/dl, random urinary creatinine 121 mg/dl, urineprotein/creatinine ratio of 0.8 and hemoglobin A1c 5.1%.The inverse creatinine to time plot as shown in figure 1clearly demonstrates the stabilization of the renal func- tion 15 months following his weight loss surgery. The patient was being evaluated for pre-emptive renal trans-plantation and because of his previous history of coronaryartery disease he underwent a left heart catheterizationstudy in March 2005. Unfortunately, despite all precau- tions he developed radio-contrast induced nephropathy and had to be initiated on renal replacement therapy. Hecurrently remains on dialysis and is awaiting a renal trans-plantation, which would not have been possible withouthis weight loss. Discussion The case report presented here illustrates the benefits ofweight reduction on the progression of kidney disease.There are few studies investigating the pathophysiology ofobesity and its early effects on kidney structure and func-tion. Clinical as well as laboratory animal studies have suggested the role of glomerular hypertension due to renal vasodilatation and increase in hydrostatic pressureleading to increased glomerular wall stress and increasedtubular sodium absorption [10,11]. The other proposedmechanism of excessive tubular sodium re-absorptioninclude increased intra-renal pressures caused by theexcess accumulation of adipose tissue in the viscera with compression of the loop of Henle and vasa recta leading to sluggish flow in the renal tubules and vasa recta andthus causing an increase in the tubular sodium re-absorp-tion [9,12]. Increased sodium re-absorption in the loop ofHenle initially reduces the macula densa sodium chloridedelivery thereby initiating a macula densa feedback that causes vasodilatation of afferent arterioles; this increases renin secretion despite sodium retention and volumeexpansion. The compensatory vasodilatation of afferentarterioles resulting in an initial rise in glomerular filtra-tion rate (GFR) and increase in the glomerular wall stressleads to increased extra cellular matrix formation and fibrosis along with injury to the kidneys and nephron loss with a resultant decrease in GFR over a prolonged periodof time. There is also a growing body of evidence that obesity per se is a pro inflammatory state. Obesity is associated with increased levels of acute phase reactants, and cytokines as well as reactive oxygen species [13,14]. Glomerular hyper-filtration also causes loss of protein in urine, which pro-motes glomerular inflammatory responses thus leading toprogression of chronic kidney disease. In the already pre-existing pro-inflammatory state of obesity this could havean additive effect. Proteinuria seen in obese patients is often considered to be secondary to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.However, Kambham et al have reported a distinct obesityrelated histopathological change in the glomeruli,referred to as obesity-related glomerulopathy and was characterized by glomerulomegaly and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This entity defers from idiopathicfocal segmental sclerosis with a lower incidence of neph-rotic syndrome, more indolent course, consistent BMC Nephrology 2005, 6:7 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1471-2369/6/7 Page 3 of 4 (page number not for citation purposes)presence of glomerulomegaly, and milder foot process fusion [15]. We did not perform a renal biopsy hence we do not know whether proteinuria was secondary to obesity relatedglomerulopathy or idiopathic focal segmental sclerosis.Adequate treatment of obesity reduces proteinuria and decreases the need for medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptorblockers, which are known to further reduce the glomeru-lar filtration rate. Hence targeting obesity should benefit in maintaining and preserving kidney function, regardless of whether weight reduction is achieved by diet and exercise or by bariatric surgery. Even though there have been no largestudies directly comparing the effectiveness of differentmethods of weight loss on progression of kidney dysfunc-tion, there is little doubt that weight loss reduces hyper-tension and type 2 diabetes, the two main risk factors for development of end stage renal disease. Bariatric surgery is a rapidly evolving branch of surgical science with theaim to induce major weight loss in those whose obesityplaces them at high risk of serious health problems. Bari-atric surgery leads to withdrawal of anti-diabetic therapy in about 60% of patients, and reduction of therapy for many other diabetic patients. Eighty-two percent of the165 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients in the uncontrolledobservational study by Greenville achieved target glyc-emic control without any medications after an average of14-years follow up [16]. The SOS study was a well- designed prospective study on obese patients in which, bariatric surgery was compared with a non-surgical group.The glycemic control without medication after 2-years inthe surgical group was achieved in twice the number ofpatients compared to the control group [17]. Alexander et al studied 30 morbidly obese patients; 19 with chronic kidney disease and 11 with renal transplan- tation; and reported gastric bypass surgery to be an effec-tive means for achieving significant long-term weight lossand relief of co-morbid conditions in patients with renalfailure on dialysis, in preparation for transplantation, orafter transplantation [18].
