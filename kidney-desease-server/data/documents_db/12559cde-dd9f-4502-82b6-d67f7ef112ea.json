Development of thisguideline update followed a rigorous process of evidencereview and appraisal. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence. The strength ofrecommendations is based on the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development andEvaluation ”(GRADE) approach. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, such as optimal bloodpressure targets, lifestyle int erventions, antihypertensive medications, and speci ﬁc management in kidney transplant recipients and children. Some aspects of general and cardiovascular health, such as lipid andsmoking management, are excluded. This guideline alsointroduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressuremeasurement since all large randomized trials targeting blood pressure with pivotal outcomes used standardizedpreparation and measuremen t protocols adhered to by p a t i e n t sa n dc l i n i c i a n s .B a s e do np r e v i o u sa n dn e wevidence, in particular the Systolic Blood PressureIntervention Trial (SPRINT) results, we propose a systolicblood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg using standardized of ﬁce reading for most people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, the exceptionbeing children and kidney transplant recipients. The goalof this guideline is to provide clinicians and patients auseful resource with actionable recommendationssupplemented with practice points. The burden of therecommendations on patients and resources, publicpolicy implications, and limitations of the evidence are taken into consideration. Lastly, knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are provided.

Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the International Society of Nephrology. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc- nd/4.0/ ). The original KDIGO Management of Blood Pressure (BP) in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) guideline in theCKD population not receiving dialysis was published in 2012. Since then, completion of the Systolic Blood PressureIntervention Trial (SPRINT) sponsored by the National In-stitutes of Health along with several related meta-analyses andthe revision of BP guidelines by many guideline task forces around the world prompted the re-examination of the KDIGO guideline on BP. A Work Group (WG) was formedin 2018 and supported by the Evidence Review Team fromthe Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Group. Further, new on-line publishing software, MAGICapp, was introduced with theaim to create a “living guideline ”that can be updated conveniently. As for many previous guidelines sponsored by KDIGO, a Controversies Conference was held to help better identify the emerging evidence, ongoing controversies, and unsettledquestions. The conclusions from that conference helpedframe the Scope of Work for this guideline update. It wasdecided that, since the de ﬁnition, management, and nuances of high BP in the maintenance dialysis population aresigniﬁcantly different from those in the CKD population not receiving dialysis, the WG should con ﬁne its purview to the latter population, in keeping with the 2012 guideline. Relevant Cochrane systematic reviews were updated with literature searches conducted through September 2019 andupdated in April 2020. The primary data and meta-analysesused to generate this guideline are available on the KDIGOwebsite and MAGICapp platform ( https://kdigo.org/ guidelines/blood-pressure-in-ckd/ ). Evidence from the sys- tematic reviews was summarized into tables using the stan- dard Cochrane and the GRADE methods ( Appendix Tables 1/C03). Although no economic analyses were conducted to inform the guideline, resource use and costs were implicitlyconsidered in the formulation of recommendations. To supplement graded recommendations, the KDIGO guideline includes “practice points ”that are consensus statements representing the WG ’s expert judgment on a speciﬁc aspect of care. This format was used when no formal systematic evidence review was undertaken or there was insufﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation; yet, these practice points may at times be supported by thebest available evidence. An explicit public review process wasundertaken to obtain feedback from external stakeholders,and comments and suggestions from the external review areincorporated as appropriate. The WG identi ﬁed 2 major areas that warrant particular attention in this guideline update because of new evidence and interests emerged since the publication of the originalguideline. These 2 areas are (i) BP measurement (Chapter 1)and (ii) BP targets in CKD patients (Chapter 3). These 2issues are closely related as the systolic BP (SBP) target of<120 mm Hg recommended in Chapter 3 is contingent upon proper adherence to standardized preparation andmeasurement protocols by patients and clinicians. The term “high BP ”is used to denote BP above the target for the respective subpopulations (adult patients with CKD,pediatric patients with CKD, and kidney transplant re-cipients). This target varies depending on the particularsubpopulation. After deliberation, the guideline WG decidednot to rede ﬁne“hypertension. ”The major rationale for this decision is that the term may have epidemiologic, psychoso-cial, ﬁnancial, and other implications, and it does not necessarily facilitate the management of BP in the CKD population. Many insightful comments from the public review helped shape the ﬁnal recommendations. The main issues pertain to the perceived impracticality of performing standardized of ﬁce BP measurements, and achieving the new SBP target of <120 mm Hg. These 2 topics are tightly connected but areaddressed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, respectively. Chapter 1: Blood pressure measurement This chapter is a new addition to the original KDIGO BPguideline and includes recommendations on how to measureBP in adults with CKD. The rationale for adding this chapteris the increasing recognition of the high variability of BPvalues in the routine of ﬁce setting and the availability of re- sults of large randomized trials consistently utilizing stan- dardized, not routine, BP measurements. The key recommendation is the employment of standardized of ﬁce BP measurement for the management of high BP in adults(Figure 1 ). Standardized of ﬁce BP refers to measurements obtained using recommended preparations and measurement tech-niques, regardless of the type of equipment used. Thesestandardized procedures are presented in Figure 2 1, which is adapted from the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guidelines.In contrast, routine of ﬁce BP refers to measurements ob- tained without using these preparations and is often calledcasual of ﬁce BP. Standardized BP measurement is crucial and is an integral part of the foundation for the BP targetdescribed in Chapter 3. The BP target cannot be applied ifroutine BP values are obtained, because large randomized trials that examined target BP, such as SPRINT, employed standardized BP . Further, there is strong evidence that therelationship between routine of ﬁce BP and standardized ofﬁce BP is highly variable, for individuals with and without CKD. Thus, it is not possible to apply a correctionfactor to translate a given routine BP value to a stan-dardized BP value. It is recognized that standardized BP measurements in- crease the burden to patients, health care providers, and health care facilities. However, this recommendation is ratedas strong because the WG considers it to be essential and itoutweighs any potential burden to its implementation. TheKDIGO executive conclusions AK Cheung et al.: Summary of KDIGO guideline on BP management in CKD 560 Kidney International (2021) 99,559–569 recommendation should be widely adopted in clinical practice since accurate measurements will ensure that properguidance is being applied to the management of BP , as it is tothe management of other risk factors. The WG further provides practice points that favor the use of an automated oscillometric BP device over a manual device forstandardized of ﬁce BP measurement. However, the emphasis of standardization is on the appropriate preparations and themeasurement technique, and not on the type of equipment. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurement is a timely topic and includes home BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring(ABPM). Observational studies show a stronger associa- tion of out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements than of ﬁce BP measurements with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes inboth the general population and CKD population. HomeBP monitoring is more readily available than 24-hourABPM and may be particularly important for BP man- agement when a clinic visit is impractical, for example,during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements are therefore recommended as a complement to standardized of ﬁce BP readings for the management of high BP . This is a weakrecommendation as there are no completed large ran-domized outcome trials that target out-of-of ﬁce BP values in adults. Hence, one important future research recom-mendation focuses on randomized outcomes trials tar-geting out-of-of ﬁce BP. Chapter 2: Lifestyle interventions for lowering blood pressure in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis This chapter focuses exclusively on the effects of lifestyle in- terventions on high BP and does not address its effects onmeasurement for the management of high BP in adults ( 1B). for the management of high BP (2B). We suggest targeting a sodium intake <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in patients with high BP and CKD (2C) . We suggest that patients with high BP and CKD be advised to undertake moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, orto a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (2C) . We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (2B). We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-sy stem inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with high BP , CKD, and severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with high BP , CKD, and moderately increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes ( 2C). We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with high BP , CKD, and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes ( 1B). We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). Treat adult kidney transplant recipients with high BP to a target BP of <130 mm Hg Recommendation 1.1). We recommend that a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) or an ARB be used ult kidney transplant recipients ( 1C). We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ABPM should be lowered to ≤50th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C) .Chapter 1: Blood pressure measurement  Recommendation 1.1 Recommendation 1.2 Chapter 2: Lifestyle interventions for lowering blood pressure in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis  Recommendation 2.1.1  Recommendation 2.2.1 Chapter 3: Blood pressure management in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes, not receiving dialysis  Recommendation 3.1.1 Recommendation 3.2.1  Recommendation 3.2.2  Recommendation 3.2.3  Recommendation 3.3.1 Chapter 4: Blood pressure management in kidney transplant recipients (CKD G1T–G5T)  Practice Point 4.1  Recommendation 4.1 Chapter 5: Blood pressure management in children with CKD  Recommendation 5.1print & web 4C =FPO Figure 1 | Key guidance from KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for BP Management in CKD.

Dietary salt restriction. Available data from both the gen- eral population and the CKD population demonstrate thatreductions in dietary salt intake induce short-term reductions in BP and suggest that this bene ﬁt reduces the need for antihypertensive medications. Therefore, consistent withguidelines for the general population, the WG suggests thatCKD patients with high BP consume <2 g (or <90 mmol) per day of sodium ( Figure 1 ). The recommendation is rated 2C, because direct evidence in the CKD population is weak.There is also moderate strength of evidence that lowering ofdietary salt intake reduces cardiovascular disease in the gen- eral population. The systematic review conducted for this guideline, however, found no randomized trial data evalu-ating the effects of dietary salt reduction on cardiovasculardisease, kidney failure, or mortality in the CKD population.Even in trials, few participants actually adhere to a diet with<2 g per day of sodium in the long term. Recent meta- analyses of randomized trials in non-CKD populations,however, demonstrate a graded bene ﬁt in both BP and car- diovascular disease risk reduction with reductions in sodium intake. Therefore, sodium reductions that involve levels less stringent than <2 g per day may still be bene ﬁcial. There are cautions associated with this recommendation. One relates to patients with CKD and salt-wasting nephrop-athy, for whom reduction in salt intake may be inappropriate.The second caution relates to the Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension (DASH) diet, and salt substitutes that are oftenused in reduced-salt diets. DASH diets employed to lower BP are rich in potassium, and salt substitutes usually contain potassium as the primary cation. These approaches maypredispose some patients with CKD to hyperkalemia.Compliance to dietary salt reduction is often a barrier to1 2 before measurement 3 Ensure patient has emptied his/her bladder 4 Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement5 6 Measurements made while the patient is sitting or lying on an examining table 1 Use a BP measurement device that has been validated, and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically 2 Support the patient’s arm (e.g., resting on a desk) 3 atrium (the midpoint of the sternum)4 5 Either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell may be used for auscultatory readings 1 for subsequent readings 2 Separate repeated measurements by 1–2 min 3 For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse level for an auscultatory determination of the BP level 4 1 Record SBP and DBP .

The WG agrees that decreasing dietary sodium intake is likely to be appropriate in children with CKD also, with the<2g(<90 mmol) daily target adjusted for body weight. Physical activity. Intervention studies in the general pop- ulation have ﬁrmly established the bene ﬁcial effects of regular physical activity on BP-lowering, physical ﬁtness and strength, weight loss, and lower risks of dysglycemia and diabetes. In theCKD population, the evidence is much more limited. None-theless, our systematic review in the CKD population foundlow-quality evidence suggesting that physical activity decreases BP and body weight, and improves quality of life. Observa- tional data also show a dose –response relationship between greater levels of physical activity and lower risk of mortality inCKD patients. In view of these ﬁndings, the WG suggests that patients with high BP and CKD undertake moderate-intensityphysical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 mi-nutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovas-cular and physical tolerance ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation also aligns with the recent KDIGO 2020 Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD ( https://kdigo.org/guidelines/diabetes- ckd/). The WG recognizes a higher prevalence of comorbidity and frailty in the CKD population that might limit the level ofphysical activity by CKD patients and increase the risk ofadverse events. Because of this uncertainty and the limitedevidence speci ﬁcally in the CKD population, this recom- mendation is rated 2C. As a practice point, the degree of physical activity should be individualized according to thepatient ’s cognitive and physical conditions, which may change over time. Further, health bene ﬁts may be realized even if physical activity falls below the proposed targets. Other lifestyle interventions. Several other lifestyle in- terventions, including weight loss and reduction of alcoholconsumption, have been demonstrated in randomized trials to lower BP in the general population. However, insuf ﬁcient data on the risks or bene ﬁts of these interventions on BP speci ﬁcally in CKD populations preclude speci ﬁc recommendations. Chapter 3: Blood pressure management in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes, not receiving dialysis Target blood pressure. We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, as determined by standardized of ﬁce measurement, if tolerated ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation does not apply to patients with a kidney transplant or to thosereceiving dialysis. This SBP target is lower than the BPof<130/80 mm Hg recommended in the KDIGO 2012 BP guideline and is based largely on its cardioprotective, survival,and potential cognitive bene ﬁts as shown in the SPRINT trial. The overall evidence suggests that there is no renoprotective effect at this SBP level. The recommendation is weak byGRADE standards (2B) because it is based on a single, albeithigh-quality, randomized trial with a prede ﬁned CKDsubgroup showing cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts in the study cohort randomized to a SBP goal of <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg. 2Importantly, this recommendation assumes that standardized of ﬁce BP measurement is taken as described in Chapter 1. Despite the recommended SBP target, the WG emphasizes that individualization, including consid-eration of the patient ’s characteristics, tolerability, and pref- erences, is crucial in BP management, as in other areas ofmedical management. A meta-analysis from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treat- ment Trialists ’Collaboration, including trials of antihyper- tensive drugs versus placebo and trials of different BP targets, found that the proportional reduction in cardiovascular events with more intensive BP treatment was independent ofCKD. 3The meta-analysis of Ettehad et al. also reported a risk reduction for cardiovascular events with intensive BP-lowering in those with CKD, although the size of the riskreduction was less than that in those without CKD. 4The totality of the evidence supports a SBP target of <120 mm Hg over<140 mm Hg in recent large outcome trials that included a prespeci ﬁed CKD subgroup, because of the car- diovascular and survival, but not renoprotective, bene ﬁts of the lower target. In most CKD patients with high BP, including the frail and elderly, the cardiovascular bene ﬁts of a target SBP <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg appear to outweigh the risks of harm, such as acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnor-malities, 5,6and the risk of cognitive impairment may actually be lower with a target SBP <120 mm Hg.6However, the evidence supporting the SBP target of <120 mm Hg is less certain in some subpopulations, including those with dia-betes, advanced CKD (G4 and G5), signi ﬁcant proteinuria (>1 g/d), baseline SBP 120 –129 mm Hg, the young (age <50 years) or very old (age >90 years), and those with “white- coat”or severe hypertension. As such, randomized trials targeting these subpopulations are necessary. People with underlying coronary artery disease and a low baseline dia- stolic blood pressure (DBP) may in theory have an increasedrisk of myocardial infarction with intensive BP-lowering,since coronary perfusion depends on DBP. In SPRINT,however, patients in the lowest DBP quintile at baseline hadsimilar cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts from intensive SBP reduction as those with higher baseline DBP. Finally, we address target BP in diabetes with CKD. Although SPRINT explicitly excluded patients with diabetes, one subgroup with impaired glucose metabolism (fastingserum glucose $100 mg/dl [5.55 mmol/l]), however, exhibited cardiovascular bene ﬁts similar to those for patients with normal fasting glucose metabolism. 7On the other hand, Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes(ACCORD) studied exclusively people with diabetes andrandomized them to the same SBP targets as in SPRINT (<120 mm Hg vs. <140 mm Hg), but excluded those with a serum creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (133 mmol/l). ACCORD demonstrated no overall cardiovascular bene ﬁt, although there was a substantial reduction in stroke events in the low-AK Cheung et al.: Summary of KDIGO guideline on BP management in CKD KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2021) 99,559–569 563 SBP arm. The analyses of ACCORD suggest a cardiovascular beneﬁt of the lower BP target in those randomized to stan- dard glucose control but no bene ﬁt in those randomized to intensive glucose control, though the data remain hypothesis- generating.8Based on these and other data, the WG feels that cardiovascular bene ﬁts of intensive BP-lowering cannot be excluded in patients with concomitant diabetes and CKD andthat a large randomized trial addressing this issue iswarranted. Uncertainty about bene ﬁts and risks of intense BP- lowering in the various scenarios above does not necessarilyimply that intensive SBP-lowering is not warranted, but does suggest that the uncertainty and the potential adverse effects should be taken into consideration when deciding on the BPtarget for individual patients. If the patient cannot tolerateSBP<120 mm Hg despite a slow, gradual decrease in SBP over months, an individualized approach should be followed,as in many other aspects of medical practice. There is a common perception that BP-lowering is reno- protective. This concept is likely true if SBP is lowered from >160 mm Hg to <140 mm Hg. There were 3 medium-sized trials that enrolled exclusively CKD patients and compared ahigher versus a lower target BP level with kidney outcomes asprimary outcomes: the Modi ﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) trial, 9the African American Study of Kidney Dis- ease and Hypertension (AASK),10and the Blood-Pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non-diabeticChronic Renal Disease (REIN-2) trial, 11with few non- kidney events observed during the trial. A further caveat of MDRD and AASK is that both trials targeted mean arterial BP(MAP), rather than SBP or DBP . The lower target was a MAPof<92 mm Hg (equivalent to 125/75 mm Hg, 160/58 mm Hg, or many other combinations) and varied by age inMDRD. 12Whether lowering SBP from <140 mm Hg to <120 mm Hg is renoprotective is far from certain. Indeed, the long-term rate of decline of estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) in SPRINT was greater in the intensive SBP arm (<120 mm Hg) than in the standard SBP arm ( <140 mm Hg) in patients with CKD, although albuminuria during treatmentwas lower in the intensive SBP arm. 5Similar ﬁndings in eGFR differences were observed in the non-CKD subgroup inSPRINT, 13in ACCORD,14and in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes Trial (SPS3) trial.15Hence, the recommendation of target SBP <120 mm Hg is based not on renoprotective effects but on cardioprotective and survival beneﬁts. This is a clear distinction from the recommendation in the original KDIGO BP guideline. The 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline offers a target of <130/ <80 mm Hg for patients with CKD, which is more aggressive than that recommended by the European Society of Cardi-ology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH;SBP target 130 –139 mm Hg), and different from that recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE; SBP target 120 –139 mm Hg). 1,16–18 KDIGO recommends SBP <120 mm Hg, as measured us- ing standardized of ﬁce BP, because the WG takes the view thatpatients should not be penalized for suboptimal clinical practice and that standardized BP must be used to guidetherapy. Hypertension Canada also recommends a SBP targetof<120 mm Hg, consistent with the present guideline. 19 Antihypertensive drugs. There is limited evidence on the use of speci ﬁc antihypertensive agents to treat high BP in CKD. Many people with CKD and BP who are at least 20mm Hg above the target will need combinations of 2 or moreantihypertensive drugs. Starting combination therapy in suchpeople is, therefore, suggested. There are, however, no ran-domized trials comparing different drug combinations inCKD, as there are no randomized trials on antihypertensive classes other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), b-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) compared to placebo or to each other. Any antihypertensive treatmentalgorithm in CKD, therefore, beyond monotherapy, is basedon expert opinion, pathophysiologic or pharmacodynamicconsiderations, or extrapolation from ﬁndings in the general population or from surrogate outcomes. Figure 3 displays the algorithm for BP therapy used in SPRINT. 2 A recent network meta-analysis by Xie et al. , including 119 randomized trials conducted in 64,768 patients with CKDwith or without diabetes and albuminuria, examined thebeneﬁts of treating with RASi compared to other active therapies or placebo for kidney and cardiovascular out-comes. 20Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) reducedthe risk of kidney failure and major cardiovascular events. However, ACEi, but not ARB, reduced the odds of all-cause death compared to active control. In those with CKD without diabetes and severely increased albuminuria, 3 moderate quality trials (REIN Stratum-1,GISEN [REIN Stratum-2], Angiotensin-Converting-EnzymeInhibition in Progressive Renal Insuf ﬁciency [AIPRI], and Hou et al.) suggest CV bene ﬁts of RASi versus placebo in addition to kidney bene ﬁts (Figure 4 21–24). The results of AASK support the kidney bene ﬁt of RASi in CKD based on the analysis of the slope of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) over time.10 In those with concomitant diabetes and CKD with severely increased albuminuria, 2 studies demonstratedkidney bene ﬁts from RASi independent of BP control. These are the 3-arm Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial(IDNT), in which ARB was compared with placebo and withCCB, 25and the 2-arm Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Study (RENAAL), in which ARB was compared to placebo.26In a meta-analysis performed by the guideline Evidence ReviewTeam, ACEi did not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality inpatients with diabetes with or without albuminuriacompared to placebo or standard of care. The risk ofd o u b l i n go fs e r u mc r e a t i n i n ew a s ,h o w e v e r ,r e d u c e d .T h eeffect of ARBs was similar to those of ACEi (Guideline Supplementary Tables S21 andS22). A summary of the strength of recommendations for the use of RASi in the presence or absence of diabetes and variousalbuminuric states is presented in Figures 1 and5.KDIGO executive conclusions AK Cheung et al.: Summary of KDIGO guideline on BP management in CKD 564 Kidney International (2021) 99,559–569 Diuretics are often used in CKD patients with high BP because many of them have ﬂuid overload, but the litera- ture on the effects of diuretics on major clinical outcomes in this population is limited. The mineralocorticoid re- ceptor antagonist ﬁnerenone was examined for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD with diabetes in a ran-domized trial. In the Finerenone in Reducing KidneyFailure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease(FIDELIO-DKD) study, ﬁnerenone showed kidney and cardiovascular protection with modest effects on SBP (2 –3 mm Hg lower) but a higher incidence of hyperkalemia. 27 At the writing of this guideline, ﬁnerenone has not been approved for clinical use. The trial was published after theevidence review cutoff for the guideline but will be assessedin future updates. An important future research topic calls for randomized trials examining various BP targets in advanced CKD, CKDwith diabetes, and severely increased albuminuric CKD, withcardiovascular, cognitive, and survival outcomes.Chapter 4: Blood pressure management in kidney transplant recipients (CKD G1T –G5T) BP targets. There are no completed randomized trials in kidney transplant recipients that examined different BP tar- gets for clinically important outcomes such as graft survival, cardiovascular events, or mortality, to provide practice guid-ance. Therefore, in the present guideline document a de ﬁni- tive recommendation on a BP target in this population is notprovided. Instead, a practice point is put forward that suggestsa target of <130/<80 mm Hg. This practice point is identical to the recommendation in the KDIGO 2012 BP guideline andis also consistent with the target of <130/80 mm Hg rec- ommended in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Care of Kidney Transplant Recipients. It is important toemphasize that, as noted in Chapters 1 and 3, the targets fortransplant recipients are contingent upon BP being measuredin a standardized fashion in the of ﬁce. The major rationale for the discrepancy between these BP targets in the transplant recipients and the SBP target of <120Start here: At randomization visit, begin with 2- or 3-drug therapy* using a combination of a thiazide-type** diuretic, and/or an ACEI or ARB (but not both) and/or a CCBInclude β-blocker or other agents as appropriate for compelling indication Monitor as designated through follow-up Is SBP ≥120 mm Hg this visit?

Foremost is the exclusion of transplant recipients inlarge randomized trials on BP targets, such as SPRINT, thatdemonstrated cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts. Second is the concern about the higher, albeit modest, incidence of acute kidney injury and rate of loss in eGFR in the arm randomized to SBP <120 mm Hg, compared to the higher SBP arm in SPRINT. It is conceivable that the potential loss ofautoregulation of arteriolar blood ﬂow, and hence GFR, in the solitary denervated transplant kidney may aggravate thisadverse effect of lower BP on the kidney, although this hy-pothesis has not been substantiated by clinical data. The WGnotes that kidney allograft survival was unequivocally the dominant priority for patients, caregivers and health pro- fessionals in the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology — Kidney Transplantation (SONG-Tx) project. 28Hence, there is signiﬁcant hesitance to lower the SBP target to <120 mm Hg in the absence of further evidence to support its bene ﬁts.Choice of antihypertensive agents. Compared to BP targets, there are more randomized trials on antihypertensive agents inadult kidney transplant recipients. Based on results of these trials,the WG recommends that a dihydropyridine CCB or an ARB beused as the ﬁrst-line antihypertensive agent in this population (Figure 1 ). This recommendation relies heavily on the impor- tance of preventing graft loss to kidney transplant recipients and clinicians. The evidence review, which included both hyperten- sive and normotensive patients, has found that, in randomizedtrials compared to placebo, the use of dihydropyridine CCBs orARBs caused a reduction in graft loss. There are no survival orcardiovascular bene ﬁts of these 2 classes of drugs. Nonetheless, this recommendation is rated 1C on the basis of their renopro-tective effects. The bene ﬁcial effects of ACEi appear to be less well established. Randomized trial evidence shows that this class of drug reduces BP and proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients, but it has no effects on all-cause mortality or graft loss. Separateanalysis of the randomized trial data on the 2 classes of CCBsshowed that the bene ﬁcial effects on graft survival were seen in the dihydropyridines but not the non-dihydropyridines. There are other considerations in the selection of antihy- pertensive agents in the kidney transplant recipients. Forexample, in kidney transplant recipients with proteinuria, ARBs should be considered ﬁrst, given the known anti- proteinuric effects of these medications. In contrast, in theearly post-transplant period, ARBs should be avoided untilkidney transplant function has stabilized, as their acutenegative effect on GFR can be confused with other causes ofgraft dysfunction such as rejection. Women trying to conceiveor who are pregnant should be treated with a CCB, which isgenerally safe during pregnancy and lactation, whereas ARBs are contraindicated under these conditions.

Chapter 5: Blood pressure management in children with CKD BP target. Compared to the adult CKD population, the pediatric CKD population is small. Sizable randomized trialsare also more limited. A single moderately sized randomizedtrial on BP targets, the Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on the Progression of CKD in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE) trial, forms the basis of the followingrecommendation. 29In this trial, intensi ﬁed BP control tar- geting a 24-hour ambulatory MAP at <50th percentile of normal children was compared to standard BP control tar-geting a MAP within the 50th –99th percentile. The results showed a probable bene ﬁt in slowing kidney disease pro- gression and no greater risk of adverse events, such as hy- potension or an acute decrease in GFR. This study in children was not powered for and did not demonstrate differences inmortality. Primarily based on the results of this trial, the WGrecommends that in children with CKD, 24-hour MAPmeasured using ABPM should be lowered to one that isat#50th percentile of normal children with corresponding age, sex, and height ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation is rated 2C. It is unclear if the renoprotective bene ﬁts of BP-lowering extend to subpopulations characterized by different causes of CKD, levels of albuminuria, races, and ethnicities. A keydifference between the current and prior KDIGO recom-mendations on BP management in children with CKD is thatthe prior KDIGO guideline made a recommendation for theinitiation of antihypertensive medication when the of ﬁce SBPor DBP is consistently above the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height, whereas in the current guideline, all children with CKD and 24-hour ABPM MAP consistently above the50th percentile should be treated. BP measurement. In contrast to the adult CKD popula- tion that was included in SPRINT, there are no randomizedtrials in the pediatric CKD population targeting standardizedofﬁce BP with meaningful clinical outcomes. ABPM is, however, burdensome and resource-intensive. Therefore, a practice point has been added that ABPM should be per- formed annually, supplemented by standardized auscultatoryofﬁce BP every 3 –6 months in children with CKD. Proper preparations and techniques are essential for of ﬁce BP mea- surement in children, similar to those described in Chapter 1for adults, with the exception that auscultatory BP is preferredover automated oscillometric BP, since normative BP data inchildren were derived using the former technique. ABPM may not be available at all in most clinics. There are also young children who will not tolerate ABPM. In thosecircumstances, manual of ﬁce-based auscultatory or oscillo- metric BP measurement obtained in a standardized manner,targeting achieved SBP at <90th percentile for age, sex, and height of normal children, is a reasonable approach.Appendix Table 1 | Classi ﬁcation for quality of evidence GradeQuality of evidence Meaning A High We are con ﬁdent that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect. B Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it issubstantially different. C Low The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. D Very low The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect.

It is further suggested as a practice point that an ACEi or ARB be used as ﬁrst-line therapy for high BP in children with CKD. These drugslower proteinuria and are usually well-tolerated, although theliterature in children is not as vast as that in adult CKDpatients. An important recommendation for future research is an adequately powered randomized trial targeting home BP or standardized of ﬁce BP in children with CKD. Conclusions Our current guideline, updated from the 2012 version, strongly emphasizes the use of standardized measurement of BP and recommends a SBP target of <120 mm Hg in most subpopulations of people with CKD, contingent upon thistechnique. More large randomized trials on BP targets,powered for cardiovascular, kidney, cognitive, and/or mor-tality outcomes, in CKD are needed, especially for sub-populations that have not been adequately represented inprevious trials.
