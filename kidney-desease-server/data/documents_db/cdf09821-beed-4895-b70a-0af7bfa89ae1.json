Estimating such risk could allow more informed decisions and facilitate development of prevention strategies. We utilizedelectronic health records from a large New England health-care system between 2006 and 2013 to identify patients aged 18 years or olderwith a lithium prescription. Renal insufficiency was identified using the presence of renal failure by ICD9 code or laboratory-confirmedglomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min. Logistic regression was used to build a predictive model in a random two-thirds of the cohort,which was tested in the remaining one-third. Risks associated with aspects of pharmacotherapy were also examined in the full cohort. Weidentified 1445 adult lithium-treated patients with renal insufficiency, matched by risk set sampling 1 : 3 with 4306 lithium-exposed patientswithout renal insufficiency. In regression models, features associated with risk included older age, female sex, history of smoking, history ofhypertension, overall burden of medical comorbidity, and diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder ( po0.01 for all contrasts). The model yielded an area under the ROC curve exceeding 0.81 in an independent testing set, with 74% of renal insufficiency cases amongthe top two risk quintiles. Use of lithium more than once daily, lithium levels greater than 0.6 mEq/l, and use of first-generation antipsychotics were independently associated with risk. These results suggest the possibility of stratifying risk for renal failure among lithium - treated patients. Once-daily lithium dosing and maintaining lower lithium levels where possible may represent strategies for reducing risk.Neuropsychopharmacology (2016) 41,1138 –1143; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.254; published online 23 September 2015/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12 INTRODUCTION Despite the emergence of newer interventions for bipolar disorder, lithium remains a first-line treatment in all phasesof illness. US and international guidelines emphasize the importance of considering lithium treatment based on proven efficacy, understanding of long-term risks, andpotential benefit in reducing liability for suicide (Goodwinet al, 2003; Yatham et al, 2005, 2013). To date, there is little evidence that any intervention is consistently superior to lithium, particularly for prevention of recurrence of moodepisodes (BALANCE Investigators et al, 2010). On the other hand, concerns persist about the long-term safety of lithium treatment, and particularly renal toxicity. It isrecognized that a subset of individuals treated with lithium will develop chronic renal failure attributable to interstitial fibrosis, which appears to be irreversible (Grunfeld and Rossier, 2009;Presne et al , 2003). The prevalence of lithium-associated chronic renal failure has been challenging to estimate, withestimates of prevalence ranging from 1.2% (Bendz et al, 2010) to 21% (Lepkifker et al , 2004), the latter in a cohort of individuals treated with lithium for at least 4 years. (Such estimates are further complicated by the range of definitionsfor renal insufficiency, although most adopt a threshold ofglomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2,o r stage three chronic kidney disease (Shine et al, 2015).) To date, there is very little known about predictors of lithium-associated renal failure, other than age and/or longertreatment duration (Bocchetta et al, 2015; Presne et al, 2003). This lack of predictability likely contributes to underuse of lithium, because it makes it even more difficult to weighbenefits and risks for an individual patient. Some risk factorsfor nephropathy in general are well established, among themare increased age (Coresh et al, 2007), at least in part because of decreased glomerular filtration rate (Weinstein and Anderson, 2010). Other major risk factors are diabetesmellitus and hypertension (Coresh et al, 2007), as well as medication interactions (Dennison et al, 2011). These latter risk factors have also been identified in small cohorts of lithium-treated patients (Lepkifker et al, 2004). In an effort to develop a clinically useful prediction tool to estimate risk forrenal failure, as well as to identify potentially novel risk*Correspondence: Dr RH Perlis, Center for Experimental Drugs and Diagnostics, Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit,Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University, Simches Research Building/MGH, 185 Cambridge Street, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02114, USA, Tel: +1 617 726 7426, Fax: +1 617 7260830, E-mail: rperlis@partners.orgReceived 28 April 2015; revised 21 July 2015; accepted 22 July 2015; accepted article preview online 21 August 2015Neuropsychopharmacology (2016) 41, 1138 –1143 ©2016 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. All rights reserved 0893-133X/16 www.neuropsychopharmacology.org factors, we queried electronic health records (EHRs) to identify and analyze a large cohort of lithium-treated patientswith and without renal failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Overview and Definition of Cases The present study contrasted individuals drawn from an EHR who did or did not develop new onset of renalinsufficiency, defined as stage 3 chronic kidney disease, in the presence of documented lithium treatment. Patients with renal insufficiency following a lithium prescription were considered cases. Those with no history of renal insufficiency despite lithium prescription were considered controls. Sociodemographic and clinical data were drawn from the Partners HealthCare EHR, which spans two large academic medical centers, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brig- ham and Women ’s Hospital, in addition to community and specialty outpatient clinics. We identified any patients aged 18 years or older with at least one lithium prescription between 2006 and 2013 based on e-prescribing data. Outcome Definition Among individuals with lithium exposure, renal failure orinsufficiency was identified based on either ICD9 code foracute renal failure (ICD-9 586.*) or estimated glomerular filtration rate decreasing below 60 ml/min and not subse- quently improving. Estimated glomerular filtration rate iscalculated from serum creatinine levels using the Modifica-tion of Diet in Renal Disease formula (Levey et al, 1999). Patients with a history of renal insufficiency before index lithium prescription were excluded. A data mart containingall clinical data was generated with the i2b2 server software (i2b2 v1.6, Boston, MA, USA; Murphy et al , 2007), a computational framework for managing human health data(Murphy et al , 2009, 2010). The Partners Institutional Review Board approved all aspects of this study (protocol 2011-P-002231). No informed consent was required, as thisproject is a retrospective health-care utilization/clinical study involving thousands of patients and multiple years of data in which consent could not feasibly be obtained from allsubjects, in accordance with 45 CFR 46.116. Identification of Controls Using Risk Set Sampling For each case patient, the index date was defined as the firstpoint in the patient ’s health record with evidence of renal insufficiency. Each case patient was matched 1 : 3 to a control patient using risk set sampling (Langholz and Goldstein,1996). This sampling strategy randomly matches each case with a control patient selected from the risk set —all patients with a documented lithium exposure at the time of the renalinsufficiency event of the case patient. For example, considera case with a renal insufficiency event in March 2008: The risk set for this patient is all control patients with lithium exposure in March 2008. Matching was 1 : 3 rather than 1 : 1in order to take advantage of the greater number of available controls to maximize statistical power. The control patient was assigned the same index date as its matched case for the purposes of contrasting time-varyingvariables. All cross-sectional clinical variables (eg, concomi- tant medications) other than lithium level were defined basedon nearest available data at or before this visit. The Partners ’ EHR includes only medication prescription, not confirmation of dispensation, for outpatient records by prior agreementbetween the hospital system and the pharmacy data provider.Clinical covariates were defined, including the presence or absence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at any point, based upon ICD9 code and/ordocumentation in the problem list. Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (Charlson et al, 1994), a validated measure of overall burden of medical illness, was also calculated. Cohort Description and Model Development As the aim of this analysis was to develop and validate a risk stratification tool, the cohort of cases and controls was randomly divided into a training data set, comprising two-thirds of the subjects, and a testing data set, comprisingone-third. Randomization was stratified to ensure balanced representation of cases and controls in each data set. Primary analyses contrasted cases and controls on sociodemographicand clinical features in the training data set, using conditional logistic regression to calculate crude odds ratios for renal failure as well as adjusted odds ratios incorporating otherpotential predictor variables. (Odds ratios were calculated without adjustment, and then with adjustment for socio- demographic and clinical features identified in the trainingdata set.) We examined the discrimination of the logisticregression model using 10-fold cross-validation in the training set, as well as in the full testing set. For discrimination, we examined area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve (AUC) as well as sensitivity and specificity; the matched case–control design precludes reliable estimates of positive and negative predictive value. To estimate model calibrationin the testing set, we examined Hosmer –Lemeshow goodness of fit and plotted calibration curves for risk quintiles. Investigation of Medication-Specific Risk We also examined possible medication-related features for association with renal insufficiency in the full cohort; theywere not incorporated in risk models as they represent time- varying elements of treatment. These included lithium preparation (citrate, carbonate standard release, or carbonatesustained release), lithium dosing frequency (multiple daily dosing vsdaily dosing), mean and most recent lithium level, and concomitant psychotropic medications (first-generationantipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, and newer antidepressants). For medication preparation and dosing, we utilized the most recent prescription before the index date(ie, when renal insufficiency was identified or during the matched exposure period in controls). For lithium level, we measured mean lithium level before index date, censoringthe 90-day period before index date in case lithium level wasinfluenced by early and unrecognized decline in renal function. In sensitivity analysis, we also examined most recent lithium level within 365 days but omitting the prior90 days. To capture possible nonlinear effects of lithium level, values were categorized a priori aso0.6, 0.6 –0.8, 0.8 –1, and41 mEq/l. (See Supplementary Methods for additional analyses including lithium toxicity.)Lithium risk stratification for renal failure VM Castro et al 1139 Neuropsychopharmacology RESULTS C o h o r tD e s c r i p t i o na n dM o d e lD e v e l o p m e n t In all, we identified 1445 patients who met criteria for renal insufficiency during follow-up, and matched them 1 : 3 to4306 lithium-treated controls using risk set sampling.Duration of documented lithium exposure ranged from1 day to more than 9 years (median 178 days, mean501 days). Median duration of documented lithium treatmentbased on e-prescribing among cases was 158 days (IQR =60– 841) vs180 days (IQR =60–539) for controls ( z=−0.89; p=0.37). The full cohort was randomly split into a training (N=3834) and testing ( N=1917) data set; characteristics of the two cohorts are presented in Supplementary Table 1. In the training set, cases and controls differed significantly on nearly all baseline features, including age, sex distribution,and lifetime comorbidity (Table 1). Table 2 presents oddsratios for renal insufficiency adjusted for all other baseline clinical features. In regression models, terms significantly(adjusted po0.01) associated with renal insufficiency included older age, female sex, history of smoking, history of hypertension, overall burden of medical comorbidity asmeasured by Charlson index, and lifetime diagnosis ofschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. (In sensitivity analysis excluding ICD9-defined renal failure, results were essentially unchanged (not shown); likewise, incorporatingduration of documented lithium treatment did not mean- ingfully change results (Supplementary Methods).) The ability of a regression model to discriminate individuals who develop renal insufficiency was examined by comparing observed to predicted outcomes. In 10-fold cross-validation in the original training set, the resultinglogistic model yielded an AUC of 0.81; likewise, in theindependent testing data set, AUC was 0.81. In the testing data, 81% of subjects were correctly classified, sensitivity for renal insufficiency was 45% and specificity was 92%. Withsensitivity constrained at 80%, specificity was 68%. The model was well calibrated in the testing set (Figure 1; Hosmer –Lemeshow X2 (3df) =2.45; p=0.48), with 359/483 (74%) of renal insufficiency cases among the top two quintiles. Recognizing that Charlson score requires long- itudinal data that may be unavailable and insurance type maylimit generalizability, we re-fit the model in the training set omitting those two variables (Supplementary Table 2), resulting AUC was 0.81 in the testing set. Investigation of Medication-Specific Risk We also examined whether concomitant psychotropic medications, or specific lithium preparation or dosing, might influence renal failure risk. As these are modifiable, time-varying elements of treatment that might moderate risk, they were examined in the full cohort rather than utilized for prediction. Table 3 shows crude (univariate) odds ratios foreach element of treatment in the full cohort, as well as oddsratios for partially adjusted (for elements of the clinical model derived above) and fully adjusted (clinical, plus all other treatment variables) models. Significantly reduced riskwas observed among individuals receiving once-daily lithiumTable 1 Comparison of Lithium-Associated Renal Failure Cases with Controls, Training Data Set Feature Cases (N=991)Controls (N=2859)Comparison nPct (%) n pct (%) X2 (1df)* Sex, male 364 37 1314 46 25.50 Race, white 867 87 2318 81 21.16 Insurance, private 403 41 1157 40 0.01 Hypertension, lifetime 605 61 710 25 429.18Diabetes mellitus, lifetime 306 31 354 12 177.24 Smoking, lifetime 349 35 665 23 54.23 Schizophrenia or schizoaffective, any visit206 21 378 13 32.74 Feature Mean SD Mean SD Student's t-test Age (years) 54.25 14.27 39.80 15.90 25.31 Adjusted Charlson Index 4.15 3.93 1.55 2.56 23.72 *po0.001 for all contrasts except insurance ( p=0.91).

In fully-adjusted models, treatment with standard antipsy-chotics was associated with increased renal failure risk, whereas newer antidepressants were associated with reduced risk. Notably, although univariate analyses suggested aprotective effect for atypical antipsychotics, fully adjustedmodels indicate that this effect is likely to arise from confounding. Finally, mean lithium levels were also examined in regression models, excluding the 90 days before index visit. Mean levels were available for 2650 subjects, including 926 (35%) with subsequent renal failure. To allow for nonlineareffects, lithium level was binned in 0.2 mEq/l increments, with levels less than 0.6 compared with greater values. In univariate analyses, odds ratios for 0.6 –0.8, 0.8 –1.0, and 41.0 were 1.41 (95% CI =1.17–1.70), 1.98 (95% CI =1.58– 2.48), and 2.23 (95% CI =1.55–3.20), respectively. In fully adjusted models, odds ratios were 1.42 (95% CI =1.14–1.77), 2.03 (95% CI =1.56–2.65), and 2.20 (95% CI =1.43–3.38), respectively. (Supratherapeutic lithium level was also sig- nificantly associated with risk; Supplementary Results.) DISCUSSION In this analysis of more than 5700 lithium-treated patients, including more than 1400 with renal insufficiency in the context of lithium treatment, we identified robust associations with risk. These include known general clinical risk factors forrenal failure, including hypertension and diabetes, as well asnovel ones, including at least one lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia. A model incorporating sociodemographic and clinical features yielded an AUC exceeding 0.81 in atesting cohort, suggesting the potential informativeness of integrating these features to stratify risk. For example, to achieve 80% sensitivity for renal failure (ie, 80% of those whodevelop renal failure would be predicted to develop renal failure), specificity is 68% (ie, 68% of those who do not develop renal failure would be predicted to not develop renalfailure). Although these values cannot substitute for ongoingmonitoring, they may at least assist in estimating relative degrees of risk. Dosing and Concomitant Medications as Risk Factors We hypothesized that once-daily lithium, vsmore frequent dosing, might be associated with lesser risk of renal toxicity. More than 20 years ago, another nephrotoxin, gentamicin,was shown to be safer when dosed once daily (Prins et al, 1993). The safety of single daily dosing for lithium has been suggested based on small cohorts and short-term investiga-tions, but not examined in large cohorts (Carter et al, 2013). Here, we observed a significantly decreased risk of renal insufficiency among those receiving once-daily lithium, aneffect independent of preparation —indeed, sustained vs standard release lithium was not associated with decreased risk. Absent randomized treatment assignment, we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding, clinicians may bemore apt to prescribe lithium in divided doses to individuals with greater risk for nephrotoxicity. However, none of the known risk factors for renal disease included in ourregression models explain the observed risk. Given thatonce-daily dosing may have other advantages in terms of toxicity, with no known impact on efficacy or pharmacoki-netics (Abraham et al, 1992; Perry et al, 1981), and has the additional likely advantage of improved adherence (Bae et al, 2012; Laliberte et al, 2013), we would argue that once-daily dosing should represent the default approach to treatment. We also report evidence of increased risk associated with use of typical antipsychotic medications, but not atypicalantipsychotics, as well as a possible protective effect fornewer antidepressants. Given the increasing use of anti- psychotics among mood disorder patients, and the particular risks associated with second-generation antipsychotics,further study to understand or disprove these potential riskor protective factors will be important. One possible alternateexplanation for the observed effects might be that treatmentsact as a proxy for unobserved illness severity or psychosis,although their persistence after incorporation of priorschizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis make this some-what less likely. Similarly, although this effect might beexplained by older patients being more likely to receivetypical antipsychotic than younger patients, the association persisted in spite of controlling for age. Conversely, the first- generation antipsychotic risk may explain the risk observedwith individuals with a history of schizophrenia orschizoaffective disorder, if these individuals received treat-ment with such medications in the past. Finally, we observed increasing risk with greater lithium trough levels, such that odds of renal failure are more thantwofold greater among individuals with lithium levels of0.8 mEq/l or greater. Our result adds to an abundantliterature suggesting risks of dosing lithium beyond this levelare significant, and without clear additional benefit comparedwith lower doses. (Supplementary analyses confirmingelevated risk with even one lithium level exceeding 1.2mEq/l may indicate another reason to aim for lower doseswhere feasible.) More generally, although the optimal clinicaldose for efficacy remains disputed 25 years after the last large randomized trial to address this question (Gelenberg et al, 1989; Nolen and Weisler, 2013; Perlis et al, 2002), this finding underscores the importance of considering the long-termhealth and safety of a patient when making decisions about Figure 1 Calibration curve for renal failure model, testing data set. The curve compares the proportion of individuals in each risk quintile with observed renal failure, to the proportion predicted to develop renal failure.Lithium risk stratification for renal failure VM Castro et al 1141 Neuropsychopharmacology dosing. As with the other risks identified, only randomized trials can fully exclude the possibility of confounding. Limitations By design, we did not intend to estimate the absolute risk associated with lithium exposure, more appropriate to a cohort design (Shine et al , 2015), or to distinguish renal failure, which may be multifactorial. The former remains a subject of debate, with most but not all studies finding a modest but nonzero increase in risk, particularly with long-term treatment (Bendz et al , 2010; Bocchetta et al , 2015; Lepkifker et al, 2004; Shine et al, 2015). The decision to focus on all-cause renal failure here recognizes that multiple factors may contribute to nephropathy, and that it maysometimes be difficult to distinguish etiology. Moreover, even in cases where histopathology strongly suggests a particular etiology, it is possible that lithium treatment maycontribute to increased risk. Therefore, we elected to simply estimate risk for nephropathy in general among lithium- treated patients, recognizing that some of the identified riskfactors will not be specific to lithium per se . Likewise, for concomitant diagnoses such as hypertension, it is possible that the treatments rather than the diagnosis per se contributes to the observed risk. Nonetheless, it seemsadvisable that clinicians be aware of all risk factors for kidney disease in the patients they treat with lithium. Another important further caveat in interpreting these results is the relatively short follow-up duration. Previous reports have examined long-term follow-up, in some cases up to 30 years (Lepkifker et al, 2004), although in cohorts an order of magnitude smaller; a recent investigation of lithium exposure vsunexposed individuals also included fewer exposed individuals (Shine et al, 2015). We note that given the relatively low rate of renal failure among lithium-treated patients, misclassification would be low even in an unscreened set of controls. Moreover, any remaining misclassificationwould be expected to bias associations toward the null —as such, it is possible that we underestimate the risk associated with some of the variables identified, but misclassification should not lead to inflation of risk in this context. In aggregate, these results suggest that it is possible to stratify risk for renal failure among lithium-treated patients. We would emphasize that discrimination —and, in particu- lar, specificity —is not sufficient to justify discontinuing oravoiding lithium treatment in higher-risk individuals. However, our model may be useful in identifying individualsrequiring more frequent surveillance for renal function, and perhaps in developing strategies, including dosing strategies, to reduce nephropathy risk. In light of the markedefficacy of lithium for many bipolar disorder patients, approaches to making lithium treatment safer and more acceptable to patients merit further emphasis and investmentof resources.
