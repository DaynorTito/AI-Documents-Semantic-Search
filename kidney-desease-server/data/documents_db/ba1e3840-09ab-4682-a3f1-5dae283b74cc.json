The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and risk factors of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency in overweight/obese adults. Methods: Individuals who at- tended checkup at the Second Af ﬁliated Hospital of Xi ’an Jiaotong University from 2016 to 2021 were included. The prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m2)i n overweight/obesity was estimated. Propensity score- matched analysis, univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Results: From 2016 to 2021, the prevalence of MAFLD in overweight/obesity reached its highest of 44.7% in 2017 and its lowest of 36.9% in 2018; and 33.9% in 2021and 21.8% in 2019 is the highest and lowest prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency, respectively. MAFLD was more common in men, old individuals, and persons with a higher body mass index (BMI) and was characterized bysigni ﬁcant renal insuf ﬁciency. MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁ- ciency was more common in women, old individuals, and persons with a higher BMI and was characterized by sig-niﬁcant metabolic dysfunction and liver ﬁbrosis. Multivari- able analysis showed that BMI, uric acid, and ﬁbrosis (evaluated with noninvasive liver ﬁbrosis score [ ﬁbrosis-4]) were independent risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf- ﬁciency. Conclusion: The prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency in overweight/obese adults is quite high in the last 5 years. BMI, uric acid, and ﬁbrosis are independent risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by S.

It affects 25–30% of the global population and signi ﬁcantly in- creases the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Currently, there are no approved drugs for NAFLD [2]. To better understand the disease and advanceresearch, in 2020, the international community of hep- atologists reached a consensus to rename NAFLD as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease(MAFLD). The diagnostic criteria for MAFLD are based on the presence of hepatic steatosis (documented either by imaging, blood biomarkers/scores, or liver histology)combined with one of the following three conditions: overweight or obesity (de ﬁned as body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m 2in Caucasians or BMI ≥23 kg/m2in Asians), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic dysfunction [3–5]. In contrast to NAFLD, MAFLD is a de ﬁnitive di- agnosis that does not require the exclusion of alcoholconsumption and other comorbid liver diseases (e.g., viral hepatitis) [6]. MAFLD places more emphasis on metabolic dysfunction than NAFLD, identifying a group with highernumber of comorbidities and a worse prognosis [7, 8]. More than 2.2 billion people worldwide are overweight or obese, which has become a global health problem.Overweight/obesity lead to the development of the met- abolic syndrome and various comorbidities, including MAFLD, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and malignancy [9, 10]. The prevalence of overweight/obesity correlates withthe prevalence and severity of MAFLD, and epidemio- logical data suggest that obese people make up the majority of the MAFLD population [11, 12]. Overweight/obesity isassociated not only with simple steatosis but also with progressive liver disease including steatohepatitis, cir- rhosis, and liver cancer [13]. Finally, overweight/obesity isnot only associated with all-cause mortality but also in- crease liver-related mortality in patients with NAFLD [13, 14]. Therefore, the new de ﬁnition of MAFLD includes overweight/obesity as one of the three major diagnostic criteria. With the rede ﬁnition of NAFLD, there is a need to reevaluate the epidemiology, mechanisms, treatment, andmanagement of MAFLD. The relationship between MAFLD and various metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemiahas been fairly well studied [15, 16]. However, relatively few studies have been conducted on MAFLD and renal insufﬁciency, especially in overweight/obese populations, and it is not fully understood what characteristics ofMAFLD are more likely to result in renal insuf ﬁciency. Meanwhile, there is a lack of information on trends in theprevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency in large- scale populations. Based on the strong relationship be- tween overweight/obesity and MAFLD as well as CKD [9,10], this study aimed to establish the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of MAFLD with renal insufﬁciency in overweight/obese adults in a large pop- ulation, thus providing a basis for the management of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Materials and Methods Study Subjects and Data Collection This cross-sectional study included individuals who had health checkups performed at the Second Af ﬁliated Hospital of Xi ’an Jiaotong University from January 2016 to December 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Af- ﬁliated Hospital of Xi ’an Jiaotong University. Consent was obtained from the health checkup subjects for the use of their examination data. Figure 1 shows the ﬂowchart for the inclusion and exclusion of subjects in the study. We used only data from 2021 in our analysis of risk factors for MAFLD and MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency be- cause the same individuals on physical examination may exist in different years. Subjects with complete information on BMI, sex, age (≥18 years), and results of the abdominal ultrasound were included in the prevalence trend analysis. Subjects with complete data on sex, age, BMI, abdominal ultrasound, platelet count, systolic bloodpressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), alanine amino- transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Scr) were included in the analysis of clinical characteristics. Diagnostic Criteria The diagnostic criteria for MAFLD are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis (detected by abdominal ultrasound) combined with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥23 kg/m 2). Additional diagnostic criteria include elevated SBP ( ≥130 mm Hg), elevated DBP (≥85 mm Hg), elevated FBG ( ≥5.6 mmol/L), elevated TG (≥1.7 mmol/L), elevated TC ( ≥5.2 mmol/L), reduced HDL-C (<1.0 mmol/L for men and <1.3 mmol/L for women), elevated LDL-C ( ≥3.1 mmol/L), elevated UA ( ≥416 μmol/L for men and≥357μmol/L for women), and elevated ALT ( >40 IU/L). The ﬁbrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, a noninvasive tool to predict ﬁbrosis, was calculated as follows: FIB-4 = age (years) × AST (IU/L)/square root of platelet count (109/L) × ALT (IU/L). In accordance with the AGA guidelines [17], ﬁbrosis in MAFLD was classi ﬁed as no signiﬁcantﬁbrosis (FIB-4 <1.3), uncertain risk of signi ﬁcant liver ﬁbrosis (1.3 ≤FIB-4 <2.67), and high risk of signi ﬁcant ﬁbrosis (FIB-4 ≥2.67). FIB-4 ≥1.3 was used as a threshold in the analysis of impact of ﬁbrosis on MALFD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation [18, 19]: 2 Obes Facts DOI: 10.1159/000533626Shi/Deng/Ma/Yang/Tantai/Wang/Chang/ Wang/Guo/Lu/Shi eGFR = 141 × min (Scr/ κ,1 )α×m a x( S c r / κ,1 )−1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 (if female), where κis 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is−0.329 for females and −0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/ κor 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/ κor 1. Renal insuf ﬁciency was de ﬁned as eGFR ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago IBM Corporation). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match the sex and age differences. Count data were expressed as n(%), and the χ2test was used. A nonparametric test was used for the comparison of rank data . All non-normally distributed measurement data were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges, M (P25-P75), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Binary multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors for MAFLD and MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between BMI and eGFR, with the r value being the correlation co- efﬁcient. p<0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant.Results Prevalence of MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency in Overweight/Obese Adults in 2016 –2021 From 2016 to 2021, 246,793 health checkups (133,331 males, 113,462 females) were included. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in total reached the highest of 62.3% in 2019 and the lowest of 51.6% in 2017; in yearly overweight/obesity, the prevalence of MAFLD reached itshighest of 44.7% in 2017 and its lowest of 36.9% in 2018; and 33.9% in 2021 and 21.8% in 2019 is the highest and lowest prevalence of renal insuf ﬁciency in MAFLD, re- spectively. The prevalence of both overweight/obesity and MAFLD was signi ﬁcantly higher in men than in women (p<0.001) (Fig. 2a, b). However, the prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency was signi ﬁcantly higher in women than in men ( p<0.001) (Fig. 2c). a bFig. 1.

MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency in Overweight/ObesityObes Facts DOI: 10.1159/0005336263 Prevalence of MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency at Different Ages in 2021 We analyzed the prevalence of MAFLD with renal in- sufﬁciency at different ages using data from 2021. Health checkups in 2021 were divided into six age-groups: 18–29 years old, 30 –39 years old, 40 –49 years old, 50–59 years old, 60 –69 years old, ≥70 years old. The prevalence of overweight/obesity, MAFLD, and MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency differed by age-groups. The prev- alence of overweight/obesity is highest in the 50 –59 age- group (62.2%), and the prevalence of MAFLD in overweight/obesity is highest in the 40 –49 age-group (45.5%). However, the prevalence of MAFLD with renalinsufﬁciency showed an increasing trend with age (Fig. 2d).Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors of MAFLD in Overweight/Obese Adults Compared with non-MAFLD, MAFLD was more commonly seen in men, old subjects, and subjects with ahigh BMI. All clinical characteristics were compared before and after PSM for gender and age. Compared with the non-MAFLD group, the MAFLD group had moresevere metabolic dysfunction (a higher percentage of the population had elevated SBP, DBP, FBG, TG, TC, LDL-C, and UA and reduced HDL-C), more prevalent liverdamage (increase in ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and TBIL), and renal injury (elevation of BUN with Scr and re- duction in eGFR) (Table 1). Multivariable regressionanalysis showed that male sex, high BMI, elevated SBP, a b c d Fig. 2.

Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors of MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency Compared with MAFLD with normal renal function, MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency was more frequently seen in women, older individuals, and individuals with higher BMI. Also, more pronounced metabolic dysfunction and more severe ﬁbrosis were present in the MAFLD with the renal insuf ﬁciency group (Table 2). However, the trans- aminases in the MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency group were instead lower than those in the normal renal functiongroup. These results are consistent before and after using PSM with sex and age. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that BMI, elevated UA, and ﬁbrosis were inde- pendent risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency(Fig. 3b). Also, we found that elevated ALT was also a risk factor for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency after multivariate analysis, which was different from the univariate analysis. Further analysis revealed that BMI and eGFR have a negative correlation ( r=−0.533, p<0.001, Fig. 4a). We also analyzed the distribution of eGFR after MAFLD was di- vided into groups with and without elevated UA, groups with and without elevated ALT, and groups with differentFIB-4 values. The results found that the prevalence of renal insufﬁciency was higher in the elevated UA group, higher FIB-4 group, and non-elevated ALT group (Fig. 4b –d). Discussion According to the Global Burden of Disease project, a total of 2.2 billion people worldwide are overweight/obese. The latter group includes 107.7 million childrenTable 1.

MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency in Overweight/ObesityObes Facts DOI: 10.1159/0005336265 and 603.7 million adults, with an overall prevalence of obesity being 5.0% and 12.0%, respectively [20]. The most recent data show that more than half of Chinese adults are overweight (34.3%) or obese (16.4%). This corresponds to 600 million overweight/obese people, the highest number in any country. Over the past 30 years, overweight/obesityrates have increased in all age-groups, by an average of about 2.5 times [21]. Both globally and in China, there are sex, age, and geographical differences in the prevalence ofoverweight and obesity, which are mainly related to genetics, hormones, work stress, lifestyle, and diet [20]. The data also showed that the prevalence of overweight/ obesity is higher among adult men than women. Our study showed that the prevalence of overweight/obesity in total reached the highest of 62.3% in 2019 and the lowestof 51.6% in 2017, and the prevalence was signi ﬁcantly higher in males than in females. Further analysis indi- cated that the prevalence of overweight/obesity differed by a b Fig. 3.

The prevalence of overweight/obesity has been shown to correlate with the prevalence and severity of NAFLD. According to the latest name change recom- mendations, MAFLD is diagnosed based on imagingsuggestive of hepatic steatosis with the presence of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2in Caucasians or BMI≥23 kg/m2in Asians). A meta-analysis of 116 relevant studies including 2,667,052 cases [22] showed that the global prevalence of MAFLD in the overweight/obese population was 50.7%, with a higher prevalence in men(59.0%) than in women (47.5%). The same meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of MAFLD in China was 51.5% and was higher in the middle-aged (56.3%) than in theyoung and old population. In our study, the prevalence of MAFLD in yearly overweight/obesity reached its highest of 44.7% in 2017 and its lowest of 36.9% in 2018, with thevalue signi ﬁcantly higher in males than in females. The prevalence of MAFLD in overweight/obesity is highest in the 40 –49 age-group. These ﬁndings are consistent withage differences in the prevalence of obesity/overweight and recon ﬁrm the link between MAFLD and overweight/ obesity. Overall, our results showed a slightly lower prevalence of overweight/obese MAFLD than previousstudies, but the sex- and age-dependent differences were generally consistent with the current study [23]. The prevalence of CKD is increasing globally with the increase in overweight/obesity, diabetes, hyper- tension, and aging. NAFLD has also been reported to affect the development of CKD. The prevalence of CKDranged from approximately 20 –55% among patients with NAFLD compared to 5 –30% among their coun- terparts without NAFLD [24]. MAFLD places moreemphasis on metabolic dysfunction than NAFLD. However, relatively few studies have been conducted on the prevalence trends on MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁ- ciency, especially in overweight/obese populations. Marenao et al. ’s study showed that MAFLD is inde- pendently associated with a new onset of CKD andTable 2.

MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency in Overweight/ObesityObes Facts DOI: 10.1159/0005336267 predicts the risk for development of CKD better than fatty liver or NAFLD [25]. O ne recent cross-sectional study found that MAFLD individuals had a lower eGFR and a greater prevalence of CKD (29.60% vs. 26.56%)than NAFLD individuals [19]. In our study, the prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency (eGFR ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m 2) in yearly overweight/obesity reached its highest of 33.9% in 2021 and its lowest of 21.8% in 2019. The prevalence of MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency was signi ﬁcantly higher in women than in men, showing an increasing trend with age. Previous research documented that NAFLD is as- sociated with metabolic syndrome components, such as obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperten- sion, and hyperlipidemia, and NAFLD was considered ahepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome [26]. Given the sex and age differences in the prevalence ofMAFLD in the overweight and obese population, we utilized PSM for sex and age. We found that in com- parison with the non-MAFLD group, the MAFLD group had a higher BMI and a signi ﬁcantly higher fraction of the population with elevated SBP, DBP, FBG, TG, TC, LDL-C, and UA and reduced HDL-C, before and after PSM. Further multivariable analysis foundthat male sex, high BMI, and elevated SBP, DBP, FBG, TG, LDL-C, and UA, as well as reduced HDL-C, were all independent risk factors for MALFD. In the overweight/obese populations, liver function indicators, including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and TBIL, were signi ﬁcantly higher in MAFLD patients than in non-MAFLD individuals. These data indicate the presence of liver dysfunction in MAFLD patients, which is consistent with previous studies pointing toNAFLD as the most common cause of unexplained liver function abnormalities [27]. ab cd Fig. 4. eGFR proportion in different BMI, UA, ALT, and FIB-4. aScatter plot of BMI and eGFR. beGFR proportion in non-elevated and elevated UA groups. ceGFR proportion in non-elevated and elevated ALT groups. deGFR proportion in different FIB-4 groups. 8 Obes Facts DOI: 10.1159/000533626Shi/Deng/Ma/Yang/Tantai/Wang/Chang/ Wang/Guo/Lu/Shi Although NAFLD is a “multisystem ”disease [28], the exact relationship between MAFLD and extrahepaticdiseases, including CKD, is currently not entirely un- derstood. Several recent studies (cross-sectional studies or cohort studies) identi ﬁed a correlation between NAFLD and CKD, suggesting that NAFLD is a risk factor for the development of CKD and that the severity of NAFLD further increases the risk of CKD. Thesigniﬁcant association between NAFLD and increased incidence of CKD persisted even after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, andother potential confounding factors [24, 29, 30]. A retrospective cohort analysis showed that the presence of NAFLD was associated with a nearly 50% increase inthe risk of incident CKD over a follow-up period of 6.5 years [31]. Meta-analysis showed that the presence of advanced hepatic ﬁbrosis was associated with a higher prevalence and incidence of CKD than either non-advanced ﬁbrosis or simple steatosis, respectively [32]. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing liverﬁbrosis in NAFLD/MAFLD; however, its invasiveness limits its routine availabi lity. Sun DQ [29] found that liver ﬁbrosis was independently associated with early kidney dysfunction in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Thus, transient elastography-measured liver stiffness measurement can accurately identify thosepatients with NAFLD who are at risk of having early kidney dysfunction. Meanwhile, Eddowes P showed that noninvasive ﬁbrosis scoring systems, especially FIB-4 and NFS-index, can be used to identify patients at risk of future liver-related events including CKD [33]. In comparison with NAFLD, MAFLD is a better pre-dictor of CKD [19]. Our study identi ﬁed an increase in BUN and Scr and a decrease in eGFR in MAFLD before a n da f t e ru s i n gs e xa n da g em a t c h i n g .C o m p a r e dw i t hthe normal renal function group, MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency was more common in women, old indi- viduals, and persons with a higher BMI and wascharacterized by signi ﬁcant metabolic dysfunction and liver ﬁbrosis. Multivariable analysis showed that BMI, uric acid, and ﬁbrosis (evaluated with noninvasive liver ﬁbrosis score FIB-4) were independent risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Further analysis found that BMI and eGFR have a negative correlation, which isconsistent with previous study [34]. The FIB-4 index was used for noninvasive assessment of ﬁbrosis in this study. The prevalence of renal insuf ﬁciency was higher in FIB-4 ≥2.67 versus 1.3 ≤FIB-4 <2.67 and FIB-4 <1.3 groups, which suggested that ﬁbrosis may promote the development of renal insuf ﬁciency in MAFLD. This result also showed noninvasive ﬁbrosis scoring systemsFIB-4 can be used to identify patients at risk of renal insuf ﬁciency. Meanwhile, this study showed that the prevalence of renal insuf ﬁciency was higher in elevated UA groups versus non-elevated UA groups, which was not addressed in the previous study. This result sug-gested that UA rather than other metabolic abnor- malities was more effective in identifying the risk of renal insuf ﬁciency. However, our results presented that the relationship between elevated ALT and renal in- sufﬁciency in MAFLD was uncertain, with opposite results presented in the univariate and multivariateanalyses, and more research is needed to explore. The current literature supports the notion that renal in- sufﬁciency may be one of the extrahepatic diseases of MAFLD. However, whether renal insuf ﬁciency in- creases the risk of MAFLD or drives MAFLD pro- gression is unclear and needs to be explored by moreprospective research. Our study was based on data from a large population undergoing health checkup, and the large sample sizeand the availability of extensive clinical data enabled adjusting for potential confounders. However, the study also had some limitations. First, this is a cross-sectionalstudy in which the natural course of MAFLD and the causal relationship with metabolic characteristics and renal function could not be determined. Second, thediagnosis of MAFLD was based on ultrasonography, which is recommended as a ﬁrst-line imaging method for MAFLD by the Association for the Study of the Liver[5]. However, ultrasonography may not be sensitive enough to detect the mild hepatic steatosis [35], and therefore, the actual prevalence of MAFLD and MAFLDwith renal insuf ﬁciency may be higher. Third, some selection bias may be present since the population at- tending health screening tends to be more concernedabout their health. Conclusion Our study found that there was a relatively high preva- lence of MAFLD and MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency in overweight/obese adults in the l ast 5 years. Overweight/obese MAFLD was associated with signi ﬁcant metabolic dys- function, liver and renal injury. Hypertension, hyperglyce- mia, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia were independent risk factors for the development of overweight/obese MAFLD. BMI, uric acid, and ﬁbrosis (evaluated with noninvasive liver ﬁbrosis score FIB-4) were independent risk factors for MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency. Our results emphasize the pandemic nature and the severity of overweight/obese MAFLD with Renal Insuf ﬁciency in Overweight/ObesityObes Facts DOI: 10.1159/0005336269 MAFLD with renal insuf ﬁciency that needs to be noticed by multidisciplinary spe cialists, health care practitioners, health policy-makers, and the public.
