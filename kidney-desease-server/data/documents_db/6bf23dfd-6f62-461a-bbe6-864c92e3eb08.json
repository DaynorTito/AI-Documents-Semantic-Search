Since the publication of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)HCV Guideline in 2018, advances in HCV management,particularly in the ﬁeld of antiviral therapy and treatment of HCV-associated glomerular diseases, coupled withincreased usage of HCV-positive kidney grafts, haveprompted a reexamination of the 2018 guideline. As aresult, the Work Group performed a comprehensive review and revised the 2018 guidance. This Executive Summary highlights key aspects of the updated guidelinerecommendations for 3 chapters: Chapter 2: Treatment ofHCV infection in patients with CKD; Chapter 4: Management of HCV-infected patients before and afterkidney transplantation; and Chapter 5: Diagnosis and management of kidney diseases associated with HCV infection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population has presented some uniquechallenges. These include its high prevalence among dialysis patients, transmission within dialysis units and byinfected grafts, and the resultant increased risk of progressiveliver disease in chronically infected patients who remain ondialysis, as well as in kidney transplant recipients. Additionalchallenges in these populations previously included poten- tially reduced tolerance of antiviral therapy and choice of appropriate regimen. In 2008, Kidney Disease: ImprovingGlobal Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline 1addressingCorrespondence: Paul Martin, Division of Digestive Health and Liver Dis- eases, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33136USA.

E-mail: michel.jadoul@saintluc. uclouvain.be The complete KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prevention, Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hepatitis C in Chronic Kidney Disease is published in Kidney International , volume 102, issue 6S, 2022, which is available online at www.kidney-international.org . Received 30 June 2022; revised 12 July 2022; accepted 14 July 2022KDIGO executive conclusions www.kidney-international.org 1228 Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 HCV management in CKD, and in 2018, a complete update of the guideline was produced that encompassed the majoradvances in HCV management that had occurred in thepreceding decade, 2such as noninvasive methods for evalu- ating liver-disease severity and the availability of oral direct- acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. Since the 2018 guidelinewas published, additional DAA regimens are being used in theCKD population and kidney transplant recipients. In addi-tion, the increasing experience with the use of organs fromHCV-infected donors has expanded allograft access in kidneytransplantation. The role of antiviral therapy in treatingglomerulonephritis due to HCV infection has also been more clearly de ﬁned. As a result of these advances, we undertook an update on portions of the 2018 guideline focusing on theseevolving areas in Chapters 2, 4, and 5. Chapters 1 and 3,addressing detection and evaluation of HCV in CKD, andprevention of its transmission in hemodialysis units, respec-tively, remain current and did not warrant any substantiverevision; thus, they remain unchanged from the 2018 guide-line. This Executive Summary presents the revised recom- mendations and highlights the rationale for the revisions to Chapters 2, 4, and 5. 3These recommendations fully replace all recommendations from the equivalent chapters in the2018 guideline. 2 Chapter 2: Treatment of HCV infection in patients with CKD DAA therapy is highly effective and well-tolerated (with rare serious adverse events) in patients across all stages of CKD, including in patients undergoing dialysis and following kid-ney transplantation. Sustained virologic response rates 12weeks after treatment (SVR12) range from 92% –100% in all stages of CKD and across a variety of DAA regimens. Seriousadverse event rates attributed to DAA generally are reportedin fewer than 1% of treated patients. As a result, interferon-based therapy is no longer used in HCV. With the intro- duction of several DAA regimens active against all HCV genotypes (pangenotypic), awareness of HCV genotype is lessof a concern in antiviral therapy. However, in some countries,genotype-speci ﬁc DAA regimens are more readily accessible, and use of these regimens thus requires ascertainment ofHCV genotype prior to treatment. Multiple pangenotypic and genotype-speci ﬁc DAA regi- mens have been investigated in CKD G4 –G5ND (ND, non-dialysis), G5D (D, dialysis), and in kidney transplant recipients, and they are consistently highly effective and well-tolerated. Since the publication of the KDIGO 2018 HCVguideline, evidence has mounted that sofosbuvir, a keycomponent of several regimens, is safe for all stages of CKD,including for individuals with low glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) or undergoing dialysis. This development is importantbecause in many nations, the only available DAA regimens are those that are sofosbuvir-based. Additionally, protease inhibitors ( “-previrs ”such as simeprevir, paritaprevir, and grazoprevir) are contraindicated in patients with Child-PughB and C cirrhosis.In patients with normal kidney function, DAA therapy arrests progression of liver disease and reduces its complications, whileimproving patient survival with acceptable toxicity. Additionally,evidence exists for improvement in cardiovascular disease following anti-HCV therapy in the general population. These beneﬁts of DAA therapy potentially translate to patients with CKD as well. The KDIGO HCV Work Group agreed with otherspecialty guidelines, including the American Association for theStudy of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of AmericaGuideline [AASLD/IDSA]), that HCV treatment should bewithheld in patients with a very limited life expectancy ( https:// www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/when-whom ). CKD G1 –G5ND. As shown in Figure 1 , a number of pan- genotypic regimens can be used, irrespective of GFR. If a non-pangenotypic regimen is contemplated, identi ﬁcation of spe- ciﬁc genotype is necessary to determine its ef ﬁcacy. Dose adjustment of DAA is not required in CKD G1 –G5ND. Treat- ment duration varies by regimen (but currently is typically 12weeks), presence of cirrhosis, and prior DAA therapy. The mostrecent recommendations should be con ﬁrmed by consulting the latest AASLD/IDSA guidelines ( https://www.hcvguidelines.org ) or the European Association for the Study of the Liver(EASL) guidelines ( http://www.easl.eu/research/our-contributions/ clinical-practice-guidelines )o nH C Vt h e r a p y . CKD G5D. Similar to CKD G1 –G5ND, multiple pan- genotypic as well as genotype-speci ﬁc regimens are available for patients with CKD G5D ( Figure 1 ), with treatment du- rations varying based on DAA regimen as well as the presence or absence of cirrhosis and/or prior HCV treatment. DAA dose adjustment is also not required for patients with CKDG5D. The most recent recommendations should beconﬁrmed by consulting the latest AASLD/IDSA or EASL guidelines on HCV therapy. The majority of data on DAAtherapy in CKD G5D derives from patients undergoing he-modialysis with limited information on the safety and ef ﬁcacy of DAA in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplant recipients. Pangenotypic regimens, as well as genotype-speci ﬁc regimens, are safe and effective in kidney transplant recipients. Most of the data for DAA use in kidneytransplant recipients derive from individuals with GFR $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(CKD G1T –G3T; Figure 1 ). Limited information on high ef ﬁcacy and safety of DAA can be extrapolated from DAA use in the highly selected populationof HCV-uninfected recipients of kidneys from HCV-infected donors who at least initially have low GFR. The major concern about DAA use in kidney transplantation is the po-tential for drug –drug interactions that could occur with concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents such as cal-cineurin and mTOR inhibitors. The most recent recom-mendations should be con ﬁrmed by consulting the latest AASLD/IDSA or EASL guidelines on HCV therapy as well asthe University of Liverpool Hepatitis Drug Interactions website ( http://www.hep-druginteractions.org ).

If pangenotypic regimens are not available, HCV genotype (and subtype) should guide the choice of treatment ( Figure 1 ).

Sofosbuvir monotherapy is excluded since current DAA regimens incorporate at least 2 agents. Other regimens may be appropriate for the above populations. Readers are encouraged to consult theAssociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) or European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines for the latestinformation on various regimens. The suggested durations of treatment are those most commonly employed by the relevant studies. Studiescommonly extended treatment for patients with cirrhosis, prior DAA failure, or for some genotypes. Readers should consult the AASLD orEASL guidelines, as needed, to determine optimal treatment duration. bThe order of hepatitis C virus (HCV) regimens does not indicate a ranking or preferential order of selection. The regimens are presented in order of the quality of evidence, then by HCV genotype, thenalphabetically. The differences in quality of evidence primarily relate to the numbers of evaluated patients and small differences inmethodological quality of the underlying studies (see Guideline Supplementary Tables S5 –S7). cEstimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR)$30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.deGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, not dialysis-dependent.eRegimens in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) should be selected to avoid drug –drug interactions, particularly with calcineurin inhibitors.fStrength of evidence for CKD G4T-G5T is very low for all regimens.gEvidence primarily for patients on hemodialysis.

Testing for markers of HBV infection including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total coreantibody (anti-HBc antibody), and antibody to hepatitis Bsurface antigen (anti-HBs antibody) is indicated prior to DAA therapy. HBV antiviral therapy should be administered prior to DAA therapy if criteria for HBV treatment in accordancewith AASLD or EASL are met. 4,5If HBsAg is absent but markers of prior HBV infection (HBcAb-positive with orwithout HBsAb) are detected, HBV antiviral therapy is notrequired prior to DAA therapy, but aminotransferase levelsshould be checked regularly and HBV DNA testing should beperformed if levels of liver function tests rise during DAA therapy. If HBV viremia is present, con ﬁrming reactivation as the reason for the rise in aminotransferases, therapy for HBVshould be started. Chapter 4: Management of HCV-infected patients before and after kidney transplantation If left untreated, HCV infection decreases patient survival and allograft survival following kidney transplantation. However, forpatients with CKD G5 or G5D and HCV infection, survival is stillimproved by kidney transplantation compared to remaining on chronic dialysis. DAA therapy has also been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in kidney transplant recipients. Management of HCV-infected kidney transplant candidates. An approach to the evaluation and management of HCV-infected kidney transplant candidates is presented inFigure 2 . First, patients who are anti-HCV antibody –positive require con ﬁrmation of viremia (HCV RNA), and evaluation of the severity of liver disease and extent of ﬁbrosis, typically by noninvasive means, is also needed as outlined in Chapter 1. If cirrhosis is suspected based on clinical ﬁndings or after assessment of liver ﬁbrosis, additional evaluation is needed to determine if clinically signi ﬁcant portal hypertension is pre- sent. A wedged hepatic venous pressure gradient $10 mm Hg is consistent with signi ﬁcant portal hypertension. Patients with clinical evidence of decompensated cirrhosis (esophagealvarices or other clinical ﬁndings, such as ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, among others) or signi ﬁcant portal hyper- tension should be evaluated for simultaneous liver –kidney transplant even if they have achieved SVR ( Figure 2 ). In HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis withoutportal hypertension or in those without evidence of cirrhosis,kidney transplantation alone is recommended as DAA therapycan prevent progression of liver disease ( Figure 2 ). DAA ther- apy should be administered to all HCV-infected kidney transplant candidates, either before or after transplantation. Timing of antiviral therapy. Factors guiding timing of HCV treatment (before vs. after kidney transplantation) includedonor type (living vs. deceased donor), anticipated waiting-list time by donor type, severity of hepatic ﬁbrosis, and4.1: Evaluation and management of kidney transplant candidates regarding HCV infection 4.1.1: We recommend kidney transplantation as the best therapeutic option for patientswith CKD G5 irrespective of presence ofHCV infection ( 1A). 4.1.2: We suggest that all kidney transplant candidates with HCV be evaluated forseverity of liver disease and presence ofportal hypertension prior to acceptancefor kidney transplantation ( 2D). 4.1.2.1: We recommend that patients with HCV, compensated cirrhosis, and no portal hyper-tension undergo isolated kidneytransplantation and that pa-tients with decompensatedcirrhosis or clinically signi ﬁcant portal hypertension (i.e., hepaticvenous pressure gradient ‡10 mm Hg or evidence of portalhypertension on imaging orexam) undergo a simultaneous liver –kidney transplantation (1B). Treatment of those with mild-to-moderate portal hyper-tension should be determined ona case-by-case basis.4.1.2.2: We recommend referring pa- tients with HCV and decompen-sated cirrhosis for combinedliver–kidney transplantation (1B). 4.1.3: Timing of HCV treatment in relation to kidney transplantation (before vs. after)should be based on donor type (living vs.deceased donor), wait-list times by donortype, center-speci ﬁc policies governing the use of kidneys from HCV-infected deceased donors, and severity of liverﬁbrosis ( Not Graded ). 4.1.3.1: We recommend that all kidney transplant candidates with HCVbe considered for DAA therapy,either before or after transplan-tation ( 1A). 4.1.3.2: We suggest that HCV-infected kidney transplant candidateswith a living kidney donor beconsidered for treatment beforeor shortly after transplantation depending on the anticipated timing of transplantation ( 2B).P Martin et al.: Summary of KDIGO 2022 HCV in CKD Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 1231 willingness of the patient and program to accept an organ from an HCV-infected donor. In a patient with compensatedcirrhosis or no cirrhosis whose waiting period for transplantis likely to be greater than 24 weeks, DAA therapy can beadministered prior to transplant to allow treatment of 12weeks duration with con ﬁrmation of SVR 12 weeks after its completion ( Figure 2 ).

Previously, kidneys from HCV-infected deceased donors were offered only to HCV-infected recipients, which reduced waiting times for transplantation without a negativeimpact on patient survival. In this setting, DAA therapy shouldbe administered post-transplant to prevent progression ofliver disease and other extrahepatic complications of HCV . Deceased donor transplantation from HCV-infected donors to uninfected recipients. More recently, kidneys from HCV- infected donors have been transplanted into HCV- uninfected recipients. For these patients, DAA therapy administered at the time of transplant or early thereafter issafe and effective to prevent complications of HCV infectionin the recipient. Despite differing DAA regimens and timingof initiation, DAA treatment for 4 –8 weeks has been associ- ated with excellent rates of viral clearance (SVR12) as well asexcellent allograft function and survival, with excellent pa-tient survival rates at 1 year following transplant. Very short treatment duration ( <8 days) have been more frequently associated with viral relapse; thus, a full 12-week treatmentcourse is often required. Therapy should be started promptlypost-transplant to avoid severe acute HCV infection.HCV and living kidney donation. Potential living kidney do- nors should undergo HCV testing using immunoassay as wellas nucleic acid testing (NAT). If a potential living kidney donoris HCV-NAT –positive, an evaluation for severity of liver disease andﬁbrosis should be undertaken and donation should be deferred until after successful DAA therapy in the donor andSVR are con ﬁrmed. Living donation can then proceed if evaluation of the donor excludes extensive hepatic ﬁbrosis. HCV viral load increases following kidney transplantation due to therapeutic immunosuppression, although this does not prevent successful DAA therapy. Drug –drug interactions are an important issue to consider when DAA regimens are used inkidney transplant recipients due to shared cytochrome P450metabolism leading to substrate competition. This issue isparticularly relevant in kidney transplant recipients treatedwith calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors. The Hepatitis DrugInteractions website is a useful resource for potential drug – drug interactions ( http://www.hep-druginteractions.org ).4.2: Use of kidneys from HCV-infected donors 4.2.1: We recommend that all kidney donors be screened for HCV infection with bothimmunoassay and nucleic acid testing(NAT) (if NAT is available) ( 1A). 4.2.2: After assessment of liver ﬁbrosis, HCV- infected potential living kidney donors whodo not have cirrhosis should undergo HCVtreatment before donation if the recipient isHCV-uninfected; they can be accepted for donation if they achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) and remain otherwiseeligible to be a donor ( Not Graded ). 4.2.3: We recommend that kidneys from HCV- infected donors be considered regardless of HCV status of potential kidney trans- plant recipients ( 1C). 4.2.4: When transplanting kidneys from HCV- infected donors into HCV-uninfected re- cipients, transplant centers must ensure that patients receive education and areengaged in discussion with suf ﬁcient in- formation to provide informed consent.Patients should be informed of the risksand bene ﬁts of transplantation with an HCV-infected kidney, including the needfor DAA treatment ( Not Graded ). 4.2.5: When transplanting kidneys from HCV- infected donors into HCV-uninfected re-cipients, transplant centers should con ﬁrm availability of DAAs for initiation in theearly post-transplant period ( Not Graded).4.3: Use of maintenance immunosuppressive regimens 4.3.1: We recommend that kidney transplant recipients being treated with DAAs beevaluated for the need for dose adjust-ments of concomitant immunosuppres-sants ( 1C). 4.4: Management of HCV-related complications in kidney transplant recipients 4.4.1: We suggest that patients previously infected with HCV who achieved SVRbefore transplantation undergo testingby NAT 3 months after transplantationor if liver dysfunction occurs ( 2D). 4.4.2: Kidney transplant recipients with cirrhosis should have the same liver dis-ease follow-up as non-transplant pa-tients, as outlined in the AmericanAssociation for the Study of Liver Dis-eases (AASLD) guidelines ( Not Graded ). 4.4.3: HCV-infected kidney transplant recipi- ents should be tested at least every 6 months for proteinuria ( Not Graded ). 4.4.3.1: We suggest that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria(either urine protein-creatinineratio>1 g/g or 24-hour urine protein >1 g on 2 or more oc- casions) have an allograft biopsywith immuno ﬂuorescence and electron microscopy included inthe analysis ( 2D). 4.4.4: We recommend treatment with a DAA regimen in patients with post-transplant HCV-associated glomerulonephritis ( 1D).P Martin et al.: Summary of KDIGO 2022 HCV in CKD Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 1233 CHAPTER 5: DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF KIDNEY DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH HCV INFECTION 5.1: HCV-infected patients with a typical presentation of immune-complex proliferative glomerulonephritis can be managed without a con ﬁrmatory kidney biopsy.

As in any cirrhotic pa- tient, regular surveillance for hepatocellular carcinomaand other complications of HCV and liver disease isrecommended following kidney transplantation of HCV-infected patients, as outlined in the AASLD and EASLguidelines. Following transplantation, patients with prior HCV infection should be monitored for proteinuria,microscopic hematuria, and decreased GFR. HCV-relatedallograft injury is suggested by abnormalities in these parameters in HCV viremic recipients and should prompt allograft biopsy including immuno ﬂuorescence and elec- tron microscopy. Evidence of post-transplant HCV-asso-ciated glomerulonephritis is an additional indication forDAA therapy.KDIGO executive conclusions P Martin et al.: Summary of KDIGO 2022 HCV in CKD Guideline 1234 Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 Chapter 5: Diagnosis and management of kidney diseases associated with HCV infection Immune-complex glomerulonephritis is a common extrahe- patic manifestation of HCV infection. This can occur with orwithout evidence of mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In an HCV-infected patient with a typical presentation of immune-complex glomerulonephritis ( Figure 3 ) and stable GFR, DAA therapy can be initiated without per-forming kidney biopsy. In the event that GFR or protein-uria worsens following treatment, or if immunosuppressivetherapy is being considered, kidney biopsy should be per-formed. Patients with atypical presentations, and those withevidence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or severe nephrotic syndrome, should undergo kidney biopsy. In patients with progressive decline in GFR due to active glomerulonephritis or a cryoglobulinemic ﬂare, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy should be administered. If suc-cessful treatment with DAA does not result in an improve-ment in glomerulonephritis, immunosuppressive therapy is recommended. If nephrotic syndrome is present, treatment should be individualized based on various factors, includingseverity of kidney dysfunction and degree of nephrotic syn-drome. When immunosuppressive treatment is indicated,rituximab is generally used as the ﬁrst-line agent.5.2: We recommend that patients with HCV-associated glomerulonephritis receive antiviral therapy ( 1A). 5.2.1: We recommend that patients with HCV-associated glomerulonephritis, stable kidney function, and without nephrotic syndrome be treated with DAAs prior to other treatments (1C). 5.2.2: We recommend that patients with cryoglobulinemic ﬂare or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis be treated with both DAAs and immunosuppressive agents with or without plasma exchange ( 1C). 5.2.2.1: The decision whether to use immunosuppressive agents in patients with nephrotic syndrome should be individualized ( Not Graded ). 5.2.3: We recommend immunosuppressive therapy in patients with histologically active HCV-associated glomerulonephritis who do not respond to antivira l therapy, particularly those with cryoglobu- linemic kidney disease ( 1B). 5.2.3.1: We recommend rituximab as the ﬁrst-line immunosuppressive treatment ( 1C). Table 1 | Summary of key messages from KDIGO 2022 HCV Guideline Update /C15DAAs are highly effective and well-tolerated for treatment of HCV in patients across all CKD stages, including those undergoing dialysis therapy and kidney transplant recipients, with no need for dose adjustment Pangenotypic DAA regimens, including sofosbuvir-based regimens, and genotype-speci ﬁc regimens are safe and effective for advanced CKD (CKD G4-G5ND or G5D) and for kidney transplant recipients, and can be selected based on local practices and availability of speci ﬁc DAAs /C15If pangenotypic regimens are not available, genotypes should be ascertained prior to DAA treatment /C15Protease inhibitors ( “-previrs ”such as simeprevir, paritaprevir, and grazoprevir) are contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis /C15Particular care with DAA agents should be exercised in kidney transplant recipients given the potential drug –drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors. Readers should consult http://www.hep-druginteractions.org /C15Because of concerns about HBV reactivation during/after DAA treatment, testing for HBV serological markers (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBs Ag], total core antibody [anti-HBc] and antibody to HBV surface antigen [anti-HBs]) should be performed prior to HCV treatment with DAA therapy If HBsAg is present, the patient should und ergo assessment for HBV therapy. If HBsAg is absent but markers of prior HBV infection (HBcAb-positive with or without HBsAb) are detected, HBV reactivation should be excluded with HBV DNA testing if levels of liver functiontests rise during DAA therapy /C15Kidney transplant candidates with HCV should be evaluated for severity of liver disease and presence of portal hypertension prior to acceptance for k idney transplantation. Results from this assessment will help guide the decision of kidney transplantation alone versus simultaneous kidney –liver transplantation /C15DAA therapy should be administered to all HCV-infected kidney transplant candidates, either before or after transplantation /C15Timing of DAA treatment for kidney transplantation candidates (before vs. after transplantation) should be based on donor type (living vs. deceased donor), wait-list times by donor type, center-speci ﬁc policies governing the use of kidneys from HCV-positive deceased donors, and severity of liver ﬁbrosis /C15All living kidney donors should be screened for HCV infection with immunoassay and NAT if seropositive /C15Kidneys from HCV-infected donors can be offered to potential recipients regardless of HCV status, provided that national or regional laws and regulations allow this practice (Continued on following page )P Martin et al.: Summary of KDIGO 2022 HCV in CKD Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 1235 Conclusion The ef ﬁcacy and safety of DAA has profoundly changed the landscape of HCV management in patients with CKD and necessitated an update to the KDIGO 2018 guideline onHCV in CKD. The key messages related to HCV in CKDare outlined in Table 1 . The most signi ﬁcant new de- velopments are reviewed below. First, the ﬁnding of safety and ef ﬁcacy of sofosbuvir in patients with CKD G4-G5 and G5D adds an additional pangenotypic agent to the DAAarmamentarium and one that can be utilized in patients with cirrhosis. Second, the ﬁeld of deceased donor kidney transplantation from HCV-viremic individuals to unin-fected recipients has made major advances since the pub-lication of the 2018 guideline, with future studies expectedto reﬁne the timing and duration of treatment and provide additional information on long-term clinical outcomesassociated with this practice. Finally, the role of DAAs andimmunosuppressive agents for HCV-associated immune- complex glomerulonephritis continues to evolve with an increasingly clear message about which patients requirekidney biopsy before therapy, which can be treated withDAA alone, and which require immunosuppressive treat-ment, primarily with rituximab.

Patients should be informed of the risks and bene ﬁts of transplantation with an HCV-positive kidney, including the need for DAA treatment. Transplant centers should con ﬁrm availability of DAAs to be administered to recipients in the early post-transplant period /C15HCV-infected patients with a typical presentation of immune-complex glomerulonephritis can be managed without a con ﬁrmatory kidney biopsy. However, a biopsy should be considered if there is worsening of GFR or proteinuria, or if immunosuppressive therapy is considered /C15All patients with chronic HCV and glomerulonephritis should be treated with DAAs just as those without glomerulonephritis /C15Patients with cryoglobulinemic ﬂare or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis can be treated with both DAAs and immunosuppressive agents, with or without plasma exchange. Rituximab is generally used as the ﬁrst-line immunosuppressive treatment, although steroids should also be considered in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis CKD, chronic kidney disease; DAA, direct-acting antiviral; GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NAT, nucleic acid testing. *Denotes monies paid to institution.KDIGO executive conclusions P Martin et al.: Summary of KDIGO 2022 HCV in CKD Guideline 1236 Kidney International (2022) 102, 1228–1237 treatment of hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease.
