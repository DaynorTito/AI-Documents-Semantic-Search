Hernandez, MD, MHS Background- —Perceived risks of hyperkalemia and acute renal insuf ﬁciency may limit use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in patients with heart failure, especially those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Methods and Results- —Using clinical registry data linked to Medicare claims, we analyzed patients hospitalized with heart failure between 2005 and 2013 with a history of diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. We strati ﬁed patients by MRA use at discharge. We used inverse probability –weighted proportional hazards models to assess associations between MRA therapy and 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, all-cause readmission, and readmission for heart failure, hyperkalemia, and acute renalinsuf ﬁciency. We performed interaction analyses for differential effects on 3-year outcomes for reduced, borderline, and preserved ejection fraction. Of 16 848 patients, 12.3% received MRA therapy at discharge. Higher serum creatinine was associated withlower odds of MRA use (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% con ﬁdence interval, 0.61 –0.71); serum potassium was not (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.90 –1.11). There was no mortality difference between groups. MRA therapy was associated with greater risks of readmission for hyperkalemia and acute renal insuf ﬁciency and lower risks of long-term all-cause readmission. Patients on MRA therapy with borderline or preserved ejection fraction had greater risks of readmission for hyperkalemia ( P=0.02) and acute renal insuf ﬁciency ( P<0.001); patients with reduced ejection fraction did not. Conclusions- —Among patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, MRA use was associated with lower risk of all-cause readmission despite greater risk of hyperkalemia and acute renal insuf ﬁciency.

Key Words: chronic kidney disease diabetes mellitus heart failure outcomes research The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), spironolactone and eplerenone, are recommended for patients with symptomatic heart failure with ejection fraction of 35% or less.1Although the role of MRAs in patients with ejection fraction greater than 35% is unclear,2,3they may bene ﬁt patients with comorbid hypertension, diabetes melli- tus, or renal insuf ﬁciency. MRAs can be used for blood pressure management regardless of heart failure status, and addition of an MRA to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitoror angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy reduces proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy and can delay progression of renal dysfunc- tion.3–10 Despite clinical trial evidence and guideline recommenda- tions, MRA therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is underused in clinical practice.11Risks of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function often limit use of MRA therapy in patients with heart failure.12–14Several From the Heart Failure and Transplant Program, Inova Heart & Vascular Institute, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA (L.B.C.); Department of Me dicine (L.B.C., J.P.K., A.F.H.) and Duke Clinical Research Institute (S.J.L., M.A.G., A.S., J.P.K., A.F.H.), Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Mazankowski A lberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (A.S.); Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angele s, CA (G.C.F.); Department of Cardiology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL (C.W.Y.); Veteran Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare Syste m, Palo Alto, CA (P.A.H.).

The landmark clinical trials of MRA therapy in heart failure have had con ﬂicting results with respect to the bene ﬁto f therapy in high-risk subgroups. The RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial of patients with reduced ejection fraction and severe symptoms showed a mortality bene ﬁt for spironolactone in patients with median creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL or greater. 20Subgroup analyses from EMPHA- SIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure), which included patients with reduced ejection fraction and mild symptoms, also showed abene ﬁt for the primary end point of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in patients with an estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus.21However, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, studied in the EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Ef ﬁcacy and Survival Study), for the outcomes of all-cause mortality and cardio- vascular death or hospitalization, the bene ﬁts of eplerenone in patients with serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL or greater and those with a history of diabetes mellitus were not statistically signiﬁcant.22Finally, in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antago- nist) trial, for patients with preserved ejection fraction, spironolactone therapy did not signi ﬁcantly reduce the primary end point. There was no bene ﬁt for the subgroup ofpatients with an estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2or the group of patients with a history of diabetes mellitus.2 Building on past work from registry analyses that examined outcomes and adverse events in patients with reduced ejection fraction who were prescribed an MRA at hospital discharge,23we examined MRA use in patients with heart failure who were at greater risk for adverse events and outcomes. Our objective was to describe MRA initiation at discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and to evaluateassociations between MRA therapy and short- and longer- term outcomes in a registry-based cohort of older patients with heart failure with concomitant diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Methods The data, analytical methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of repro- ducing the results or replicating the procedure. Data Sources Data were from the American Heart Association ’s Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure registry linked to Medicare claims from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The registry is an ongoing online registry for patients hospitalized with heart failure.24Patients are eligible for inclusion in the registry if they are admitted or discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure ( International Classi ﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi ﬁcation ICD-9-CM codes 402.x1, 404.x1, 404.x3, and 428.x). The Medicare data include 100% of Medicare Part A claims and associated denominator ﬁles from 2005 through 2013. Medicare Part A includes institutional claims from inpatient hospitalizations. Denominator ﬁles include information about demographic characteristics, Medicare eligibility and enroll- ment, and mortality. We linked the registry data to the Medicare data using indirect identi ﬁers, as described and validated previously.25 Study Population The study population included Medicare fee-for-service bene-ﬁciaries aged ≥65 years who were discharged from a registry hospitalization for heart failure between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. To be eligible for this study, patients had to have a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease before the index hospitalization, as recorded in the registry. In the medical history section of the registry, diabetes mellitus is recorded as “diabetes —insulin treated ”or“diabetes —non-insulin treated ”and chronic kidneyClinical Perspective What Is New? Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are often underuti- lized in clinical practice, possibly because of concerns over risks of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. In high-risk patients with heart failure and concomitant diabetes mellitus or renal insuf ﬁciency, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use was associated with lower risk ofall-cause hospitalization despite increased risk of hospital-ization with hyperkalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁciency. The increased risk of adverse events was mostly con ﬁned to patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction. What Are the Clinical Implications? Because of the overall decrease in the risk of hospitalization for patients treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antag-onist therapy, the bene ﬁts of therapy may outweigh the risks in a high-risk population. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.006540 Journal of the American Heart Association 2MRA Use in High-Risk Patients With Heart Failure Cooper et alORIGINAL RESEARCH disease is recorded as “renal insuf ﬁciency-chronic (serum creatinine >2.0).”Patients included in the analysis were required to be new users of MRA therapy, de ﬁned as no MRA therapy at admission. We excluded patients with a contraindi- cation to aldosterone antagonists recorded in the registry. Only patients discharged to home were included. If the patient had multiple hospitalizations in the registry, we used the ﬁrst hospitalization for the analysis. Treatment The treatment of interest was MRA therapy prescribed atdischarge, as recorded in the registry. Dosage information was unavailable. Outcomes The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years. Other outcomes of interest included 30- day, 1-year, and 3-year all-cause readmission, heart failure readmission, and readmission with a diagnosis of hyper-kalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁciency. We identi ﬁed deaths based on death dates in the Medicare denominator ﬁles, and we calculated days to death from the index hospitalization discharge date. We identi ﬁed all-cause readmission using subsequent inpatient claims except those for transfers to or from another hospital and admissions for rehabilitation. We deﬁned heart failure readmissions by a primary diagnosis of heart failure ( ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 428.x, 402.x1, 404.x1, or 404.x3) on an inpatient claim. We de ﬁned hyperkalemia using ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 276.7 and acute renal insuf ﬁciency using ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 584.x on an inpatient claim. Subgroups We assigned patients in the study cohort to prespeci ﬁed subgroups based on disease history and ejection fraction for interaction analyses, using registry indicator variables for history of diabetes mellitus and history of renal insuf ﬁciency. We also categorized patients as having ejection fraction of 35%or less or greater than 35%, because heart failure guidelines recommend MRA therapy in patients with reduced ejection fraction. We de ﬁned reduced ejection fraction as documenta- tion of left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less or a qualitative assessment of moderate or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We grouped together patients with heart failure with borderline and preserved ejection, de ﬁned as ejection fraction greater than 35% or a qualitative assessment of no or mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We excludedpatients with no documentation of ejection fraction.Covariates Covariates in population comparisons and modeling includedthe following registry variables: age, sex, race, medical history (ie, anemia, atrial ﬁbrillation, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, depression, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hyper- tension, implantable cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator, ischemic etiol- ogy of heart failure, pacemaker, peripheral vascular disease, renal insuf ﬁciency, and smoking in the past year), vital signs at admission (ie, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), laboratory tests at discharge (ie, creatinine, ejection fraction, potassium, sodium, and urea nitrogen), discharge medications (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, b-blocker, antico- agulant, digoxin, diuretic, and lipid-lowering agent), and discharge year. If discharge laboratory test results were missing, we substituted admission laboratory test results. Statistical Analysis We describe baseline characteristics of the study population by treatment group, using frequencies with percentages for categorical variables and means with SDs for continuous variables. We tested for differences between groups using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxonrank-sum tests for continuous variables. We used logistic regression to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between patient characteristics and MRA therapy at hospital discharge. We describe observed event rates by treatment group. For mortality, we calculated cumulative incidence at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years based on Kaplan –Meier estimates. We tested for mortality differences between groups using log-rank tests. For other end points, we calculated cumulativeincidence based on estimates from the cumulative incidence function, which accounts for the competing risk of death, a high risk in this population. We used Gray tests to test for differences between treatment groups on these outcomes. We used an inverse probability-weighted estimator —an extension of the propensity score —to assess differences in outcomes among treatment groups while accounting for confounding by observed covariates. We obtained the weights byﬁtting a treatment selection model as a logistic regression model with treatment as the dependent variable and the baseline characteristics described above as the independentvariables. To evaluate the adequacy of the treatment selection model, we compared the baseline characteristics of each group after weighting. We used weighted chi-squared tests to test for differences on categorical variables and weighted analysis of variance to test for differences on continuous variables. We also calculated standardized differences to DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.006540 Journal of the American Heart Association 3MRA Use in High-Risk Patients With Heart Failure Cooper et alORIGINAL RESEARCH Table 1.

Balanced variables were those with a standardized difference of less than 10%. We estimated the unadjusted relationship between MRA therapy and each outcome using Cox proportional hazards models in which the treatment indicator was the sole independent variable. Next, we estimated the adjusted relationship between treatment and each outcome using weighted proportional hazards regression models. Finally, we controlled for discharge medications in addition to the treatment indicator using weighted proportional hazards models. We used robust SEs to account for clustering ofpatients within hospitals. In addition to estimating an overall treatment effect, we assessed differences between prespeci ﬁed subgroups by testing the signi ﬁcance of interaction terms between treat- ment and subgroup variables. This analysis focused on 3-year outcomes. Based on the interaction results, we repeated the main analyses for patients with reduced ejection fraction; we reevaluated the propensity model for these patients only, then estimated associations between treatment and outcomes inthis subgroup using ejection fraction –speci ﬁc weights. In post hoc exploratory analyses, we used Cox proportional hazards models to examine associations between selected baseline characteristics and the outcomes of hospitalization for hyperkalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁciency among patients who were prescribed an MRA at hospital discharge. Most variables had low rates of missingness. For variables with less than 5% missingness, we imputed continuous variables to the overall median value, dichotomous variables to“no,”and multichotomous variables to the most frequentcategorical value. For variables with more than 5% missing- ness, we treated the missing value as a separate category. We report 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs) and used a=0.05 to establish statistical signi ﬁcance of tests. All tests were 2- sided. We used SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for all analyses. The institutional review board of the Duke University Health System approved the study. Informed consent was waived. Results Of 16 848 eligible patients, 2067 (12.3%) were prescribed MRAtherapy at discharge. Table 1 shows the baseline characteris- tics of the study population. A higher proportion of patients on MRA therapy had diabetes mellitus (86.6% versus 82.2%), and a lower proportion had chronic kidney disease (27.8% versus 36.0%). In the overall study population, 6719 patients (39.9%) had reduced ejection fraction, and 10 129 (60.1%) had borderline or preserved ejection fraction. Patients receiving MRA therapy at discharge were more likely to have reducedejection fraction at admission (60.5% versus 37%), and they had higher rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/an- giotensin II receptor blocker use (72.7% versus 62.6%) and b- blocker use (87.6% versus 81.2%). After weighting by the inverse probability of treatment, baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups (Table S1). Among the patient characteristics associated with receipt of MRA therapy in the treatment selection model were age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97 –0.99) and sex (adjusted OR for women, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 –0.99; Table 2).

Reduced ejection fraction was strongly associated with MRA prescription (adjusted OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 2.11 –2.59). Although discharge serum creatinine was associated with MRA pre- scription (adjusted OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61 –0.71), serum potassium was not (adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90 –1.11). Patients on MRA therapy had lower observed rates of 3- year mortality (54.4% versus 57.5%), 30-day heart failurereadmission (7.9% versus 9.5%), and 1-year (68.2% versus 72.2%) and 3-year (84.9% versus 88.2%) all-cause readmission (Table 3; Figure 1). At 30 days, patients on MRA therapy had higher rates of readmission for hyperkalemia and acute renal insuf ﬁciency (Table 3; Figure 2), though overall only 18 patients were admitted within 30 days for hyperkalemia as a primary diagnosis.

MRA use was associated with lower risk of readmission at 1 year (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 –0.98) and 3 years (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 –0.98). These relationships remained after additional adjustment for discharge medications. In the weighted analyses, MRA use was associated with a greater risk of 30-day readmission with a diagnosis ofhyperkalemia (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.49 –2.90) and acute renal insuf ﬁciency (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09 –1.56), as well as at 1 and 3 years. MRA use was also associated with greater risk of readmission with a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia at 1 year (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.54 –4.62) and 3 years (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.42 –3.41) and acute renal insuf ﬁciency at 30 days (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16 –2.34), 1 year (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11–1.56), and 3 years (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02 –1.38). These relationships remained after additional adjustment for dis- charge medications.In the interaction analysis of reduced ejection fraction versus borderline or preserved ejection fraction, there were signiﬁcant interactions for readmission for acute renal insuf ﬁciency as the primary ( P=0.01) or any diagnosis (P<0.001), and for hyperkalemia in any diagnosis position (P=0.02; Table 5). Although MRA therapy was not associated with readmission for acute renal insuf ﬁciency at 3 years for patients with reduced ejection fraction (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.18), it was associated with readmission for renal insuf ﬁciency among patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction (HR. 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11 –1.62). There were no signiﬁcant interactions by ejection fraction for mortality, all- cause or heart failure readmission, or hyperkalemia in the primary diagnosis position. There were no signi ﬁcant interac- tions by disease history (ie, renal insuf ﬁciency or diabetes mellitus). To further explore the role of subtype of heart failure, we restricted inverse probability weighting to patients with reduced ejection fraction (Table 6). MRA therapy was asso- ciated with lower risk of all-cause readmission at 3 years (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 –0.98), but not at 30 days or 1 year. This association remained after adjustment for discharge medica- tions (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86 –1.00). MRA therapy was not associated with greater risk of readmission with hyper- kalemia. Unlike the overall analyses, there were no short-term or long-term associations between MRA therapy and hospi- talization for acute renal insuf ﬁ ciency in the analysis restricted to patients with reduced ejection fraction. In post hoc analyses restricted to patients who were prescribed MRA at discharge, we further explored associa-tions between baseline characteristics and readmission for hyperkalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁciency by heart failure subtype. Among patients on MRA therapy with preserved ejection fraction, women had a greater 3-year risk of hospitalization for hyperkalemia (adjusted HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.28–2.64) and for acute renal insuf ﬁciency (adjusted HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 –1.56; Table S2). Serum potassium was positively associated with increased risk of hyperkalemia (adjusted HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.02 –2.30). Among patients with reduced ejection fraction, women had a greater risk of hospitalization for hyperkalemia (adjusted HR, 1.47; 95% CI,1.10–1.95; Table S3), but not acute renal insuf ﬁciency (adjusted HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76 –1.19). Serum potassium was not associated with a greater risk of hyperkalemia in patients with reduced ejection fraction (adjusted HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.93 –1.90).

MRA therapy was associated with lower long-term risk of all- cause readmission, but with greater short-term and long- term risks of readmission with acute renal insuf ﬁciency and hyperkalemia. The risk of acute renal insuf ﬁciency was limited to patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction.Two previous studies using data from the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure registry examined MRA therapy in heart failure and risks of adverse events.11,23Both studies focused on patients with reduced ejection fraction. Our work expands on previous work by including patients with reduced, borderline, and preserved ejection fraction; focusing on high- risk patients with diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease; and using more-recent data.

DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.006540 Journal of the American Heart Association 9MRA Use in High-Risk Patients With Heart Failure Cooper et alORIGINAL RESEARCH In our study, 12% of patients were prescribed MRA therapy at discharge, and most of these patients had reduced ejection fraction. Using data from 2005 through 2007, Albert et al11 likewise found that MRA therapy was markedly underused inappropriate patients, though rates of inappropriate and potentially inappropriate use were low. Patient characteristicsassociated with MRA therapy have not changed substantially, with age, systolic blood pressure, and presence of an implantable cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator strongly associated with prescription of MRA therapy. However, in the previous study, history of renal insuf ﬁciency was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving MRA therapy, whereas we found no such association. We also found no association between MRA therapy and lower risk of mortality. Using data from 2005 through 2010, Hernandez et al 23found that MRA therapy was not associated with lower risks of death or cardiovascular readmissionoverall, but was associated with a lower risk of heart failure readmission among patients with reduced ejection fraction. We found lower risks of heart failure readmission at 30 days and all-cause readmission at 1 and 3 years. The bene ﬁcial long-term association between MRA therapy and all-cause readmission was independent of ejection fraction and the presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Although the appropriateness of MRA therapy in patients with preserved ejection fraction is uncertain on the basis of clinicaltrial data, our ﬁndings suggest a bene ﬁt in high-risk patients. Further study of MRA therapy in patients with heart failure and borderline or preserved ejection fraction is warranted. 2,26 Although the bene ﬁts of MRA therapy are well known, adverse effects have also been documented. Past work showed an greater risk of 30-day and 1-year admission with hyperkalemia in patients with reduced ejection fraction who were treated with an MRA, compared with patients not receiving an MRA; however, there were few hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia.23Similarly, in ourstudy patients at high risk for adverse events with MRA therapy, the risk of 30-day, 1-year, or 3-year hospitalization for a primary or other diagnosis of hyperkalemia was higher for patients on MRA therapy. In the strati ﬁed analyses, however, the association between MRA therapy and increased risk for hospitalization with hyperkalemia in any diagnosisposition was limited to patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction. Ejection fraction type did not signi ﬁcantly alter the positive association between MRA therapy and 3- year risk of hyperkalemia as a primary diagnosis; however, the absolute incidence of hyperkalemia as a primary diagnosis was very low in both groups even at 3 years. Among patients discharged on MRA therapy, women had a greater 3-year risk of hospitalization with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia in any diagnosis position compared with men, regardless of ejection fraction subtype. Notably, higher baseline serum potassium was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalemia amongpatients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction, but not among patients with reduced ejection fraction. Similar to the risk of hyperkalemia, the risk of 30-day, 1- year, or 3-year hospitalization for a diagnosis of acute renal insuf ﬁciency was higher for patients on MRA therapy; however, this risk was limited to patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction. In post hoc analyses restricted to patients discharged on MRA, the risk of 3-year hospitalization for acute renal insuf ﬁciency in any diagnosis position was greater among women with borderline or preserved ejection fraction, but not among women with reduced ejection fraction. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms of increased risk in certain populations. Despite the greater risk of hospitalization for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, there was an overall decrease in the risk of hospitalization for patients treated with MRA therapy, suggesting the bene ﬁts of therapy may outweigh the risks in this high-risk population. Past analyses from landmark clinical trials of MRA therapy in heart failure had similar conclusions, Table 5.

Novel therapeutic agents, such as potassium binders, may protect against hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure who are at risk of hyperkalemia with MRA use, though additional studiesare needed.30Furthermore, development of more-selective MRA therapies may achieve the bene ﬁts of MRA therapy with fewer adverse events.31,32In addition, appropriate patient selection and laboratory monitoring during therapy may decrease the risk of adverse events.33–35These considerations warrant further investigation. Our study has limitations. First, as in all observational studies, unmeasured confounders may have in ﬂuenced the results. Second, the population was limited to Medicare fee- for-service bene ﬁciaries, so the results may not be Table 6.

Also, patients were recently discharged from an acute heart failure hospitaliza- tion, so the results may not apply to stable outpatients with heart failure. Furthermore, hospital participation in the registry is voluntary, and the practices of participating hospitals may not re ﬂect practices at hospitals that do not participate. Third, we were limited by the data available. For the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure registry, we were limited by the ﬁelds available in the registry and the completeness of each ﬁeld, and for outcome data, we were limited to Medicare claims data. We only examined whether MRA therapy was prescribed at discharge, but we did not have information about doses prescribed. Furthermore, we did not analyze outpatient medication initiation, discontinuation, or adherence, though this has been reported in a past Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure study, which found that eligible patients who were not prescribed an MRA at discharge were less likely to initiate it in the outpatient setting.36In addition, we did not have laboratory data with which to further explore the outcomes of hospitalizations for hyperkalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁcency, so we were not able to comment on the severity of these adverse events. Finally, the results of our subgroup analyses must be interpreted with caution. For patients without quantitative assessment of ejection fraction, we used qualitative assessments, which may decrease the precision of these categories. Furthermore, we were unable to differentiate patients with recovered ejection fraction. Conclusion In conclusion, among older patients with heart failure and concomitant diabetes mellitus or renal insuf ﬁciency, MRA use was associated with lower risk of all-cause hospitalization despite increased risk of hospitalization with hyperkalemia or acute renal insuf ﬁciency. The increased risk of adverse events was mostly con ﬁned to patients with borderline or preserved ejection fraction. MRAs may be safe in a selected group of patients with heart failure and concomitant diabetes mellitus or renal insuf ﬁciency. Acknowledgments Damon M.
