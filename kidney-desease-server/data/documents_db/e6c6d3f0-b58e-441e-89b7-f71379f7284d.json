This update, based on asubstantially broader base of evidence than has previouslybeen available, re ﬂects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large anddiverse populations that help to inform care; however, thisguideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across thelifespan, and discusses special considerations inimplementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated tothe evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD,management to delay CKD progression and itscomplications, medication management and drugstewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews ofrelevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidenceand the strength of recommendations which followed the“Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ”(GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed.

Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the International Society of Nephrology. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ). This 2024 update of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) heralds a new era in the care of people with kidneydiseases. The majority of statements from the 2012 guidelinehave been updated based on current knowledge and practice.Only 6 statements were retained in their original form in 2012. There is clear and increasing recognition of CKD as a global public health problem. The inclusion of people with CKD in clinical trials has improved substantially, thus generating an evidence base upon which to recommend care and treatmentsthat have not previously existed. There are increasing efforts toimprove diagnostic evaluation of cause, with increased so-phistication of imaging methods, biopsy interrogation, andgenetic evaluation, as well as methods to optimize blood andurine testing. With advances in technology, such as moleculardiagnostics for tissue samples, integrated omics platforms, and the use of machine learning/arti ﬁcial intelligence to explore large databases of both clinical and biological data,we are truly at the beginning of a new era in nephrology. This guideline integrates existing and new knowledge to guide the care of people with CKD. It has been developed byan international Work Group that included patient partners,clinicians, and researchers with diverse experience across thespectrum of populations, a dedicated Evidence Review Team, and professional KDIGO staff. This clinical practice guideline includes 2 different types of statements: graded recommen-dations, which are supported by systematic reviews (i.e., de novo reviews conducted by the independent Evidence Review Team or existing high-quality reviews that have been sys-tematically identi ﬁed), and ungraded practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematicreview was not conducted for various reasons (e.g., lack of a sufﬁcient evidence base or randomized controlled trials that would be impractical/unethical). Both recommendations andpractice points are intended to help guide clinical practice andaid in decision-making; thus, collectively are the guidelinestatements. They are clearly articulated, actionable, and pre-sented together so that all guideline statements can beimplemented. The distinction between them is based on theprocess by which they are derived, and that process is basedon the framework methodology from the KDIGO Methods Committee and aligns with other international guidelinegroups using the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ”(GRADE) methodology. New developments in the re ﬁnement of evaluation of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), population and individual risk prediction, and novel treatments have all positively in ﬂuenced the prognosis for people with CKD and are presented here. TheWork Group has aimed to generate a guideline that is bothrigorously devoted to new and existing evidence, and that isclinically useful. Research recommendations are presented in aseparate section of the document and are intended to guide the next set of important research questions to inform and improve the outcomes of people living with CKD. We speci ﬁcally urge the community to be inclusive of people across the lifecycle andinclude sex (referring to biological factors including genetics,sex steroids, physiology, and anatomy), gender (referring tosociocultural factors such as identity, roles, and relations), andetiology of CKD as important variables in all studies. We offer recommendations to clinicians and clinical labo- ratories to understand and promote the standardization and accuracy of testing tools including assays and equipment. Theeffective use of clinical practice guidelines and, therefore,effective patient care, including accurate diagnosis and referralprioritization, clinical research, and public health prioritiza-tion, requires comparability of laboratory results independentof time, place, and measurement procedure. Key to this isestablishing precision of testing and between-laboratory agreement with traceability to accepted international refer- ence standards wherever available. Therefore, this guidancedocument includes standards for laboratory tests. Speci ﬁcally, we focus on creatinine and cystatin C, with the goal ofnormalizing access to both tests for increased accuracy of GFRassessment, and the assessment of urine albumin which is alsocritical to risk assessment and care plans. The guideline is organized into 6 chapters ( Tables 1 ,4,a n d 5 cover Chapters 1 –5). In this summary, we outline the key evidence-based recommendations together with selected prac-tice points by chapter. Readers are referred to the full guidelinefor a comprehensive description of bene ﬁts and harms, certainty of evidence, values and preferences, resource use and costs,factors affecting implementation, special considerations, andboth general and speci ﬁc research recommendations. Qualifying statements, key concepts, special considerations, Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) Clarifying de ﬁnition and classi ﬁcation. We begin with acknowledgment that the de ﬁnition and classi ﬁcation system is widely accepted by the community. Speci ﬁcally, we remind readers of the difference between the de ﬁnition of CKD, which is inclusive of various markers of kidney damage, and the classi- ﬁcation system that highlights the importance of the CGA sys- tem (i.e., Cause/Glomerular ﬁltration rate level/ Albuminuria level) for the purposes of management, treatment, risk assess-ment, and research. The relative risk of many outcomes (CKDprogression, kidney failure, acute kidney injury, infection,A Levin et al.: Executive summary of KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2024) 105, 684–701 685 hospitalizations, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarc- tion, atrial ﬁbrillation, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) is increased for all people with CKD, whereas absolute risks forindividuals are modi ﬁed by age, sex, and other factors. We highlight the difference between relative and absolute risks (the latter derived by applying individual risk prediction scores),acknowledge that there are different risks for different pop-ulations, and do not support any age-adjusted de ﬁnitions of CKD, as there are no age-adjusted de ﬁnitions for diabetes, car- diovascular disease (CVD), nor hypertension, but ratherrecognize that the individual implications of those conditionsfor individuals differ by age group. Screening. Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD, there remains controversy and lack of consensusas to the utility of population screening for CKD 1or targeted screening programs2due to the complexity of the underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public health policyhas a role to play in identifying and addressing risk factors toprevent CKD, to identify CKD early, and to delay its progressionand associated adverse outcomes. Incorporating evidence-based treatment of people with CKD with sodium-glucose cotrans- porter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, together with a systematic reviewin people with diabetes and hypertension, suggests thatscreening adults for CKD could now be cost-effective. 3,4 International considerations. In low- and middle-income countries and in the lower sociodemographic quintilesaround the world, there is a large gap between CKD burden andprovision of adequate healthcare. There is limited access to kidney replacement therapy combined with the rising preva- lence of diabetes and hypertension and evidence of substantialsex and gender disparities in access to CKD treatment.Importantly, slowing CKD progression at early stages shouldprovide economic bene ﬁts and prevent the development of kidney failure and cardiovascular complications. A systematicreview of care models in low- and middle-income countriesfound that those supporting primary care providers or allied health workers achieved effectiveness in slowing GFR decline, as opposed to interventions centered on specialty care alone. 5 Where there are resource limitations, it is logical to deploy re-sources where they will be most cost-effective, for example, tohigher-risk, preventable stages. Special considerations and updated population data. We recognize that kidney diseases affect people at different timesand with different impacts across the whole lifespan. Thus, enabling a personalized approach, considering age, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment, is critical.At the extremes of age, the very young and the very old, diag-nostic procedures, treatment aims, treatment modalities, anddecision-making differ due to differences in prognosis, treat-ment options, and prioritization. In young and middle-agedadults, treatment approaches may differ because of speci ﬁc circumstances, such as pregnancy or menopause. Sex (biological attributes) and gender (sociocultural factors), as well as other important intersectional factors, including, but not limited to,geographical location, socioeconomic position, and race/ethnicity, play important roles in kidney health and disease.Within the guideline document, we highlight concepts as towhy age, sex, and gender should be considered, and how thesespeciﬁcally impact within each of the chapters (see Figure 1 ). Multinational population studies, assessing risks, based on CKD-PC 2023 analyses, 6are presented as part of the intro- ductory chapter to further highlight updated informationdemonstrating epidemiological risk across CKD categories ona population level.

Evaluation of CKD 1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD 1.1.1 Detection of CKD Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerul ar ﬁltration rate (GFR). Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (e GFR), repeat tests to con ﬁrm presence of CKD. 1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin C – based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) ( 1B). 1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i) review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;(ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii) imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv) kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and atrophy; (v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD; (vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators. 1.1.4 Evaluation of cause Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medicati ons, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologic diagnosis (Figure 8 a). Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause based on resources available (Table 6b). Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate ( 2D). 1.2 Evaluation of GFR 1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR ”when referring to the speci ﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use the more general term “kidney function(s) ”when dealing with the totality of functions of the kidney. 1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR (Figure 11c). Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less accurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making (Table 8d)(1C). Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of a n exogenous ﬁltration marker (Table 9e). Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations in both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in ﬂuence SCr and cystatin C measurements. Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake.Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C –based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some speci ﬁc circumstances. Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may be informative, in both direction and magnitude of those differences. Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections for measured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate. 1.2.3 Guidance to clinical laboratories Practice Point 1.2.3.1: Implement the laboratory standards of care outlined in Table 11 fto ensure accuracy and reliability when assessing GFR using creatinine and cystatin C. Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurement of both creatinine and cysta tin either as an in-house test or as a referred test. Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in infants or small children must ensure their quality control process include the lowes t end of the expected range of values for the group of interest.

Evaluation of CKD Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher relative contribution of non-crea tinine chromogens to measured creatinine in children when using the Jaffe assay, and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samples in the neonatalperiod. Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2can be ﬂagged as “low ”in children and adolescents over the age of 2 years. 1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum ﬁltration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum ﬁltration markers alone ( 1D). Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as de ﬁned locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided.Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children using validated equations that have been developed or validated in comparable populations. 1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria 1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference). In all cases, a ﬁrst void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children. (i) urine ACR, or (ii) reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading. If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements: (i) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), (ii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or (iii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods. /C15Conﬁrm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (i.e., quantify the ACR or PCR if initial semiquantitative tests are positive). /C15Conﬁrm ACR $30 mg/g ( $3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order con ﬁrmatory tests as indicated (Table 16g). Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a ﬁrst morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria (in descending order of preference): (i) Both urine PCR and urine ACR, (ii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading, or (iii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading. 1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 hto ensure accuracy and reliability of the ﬁndings when assessing urine samples. Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories. 1.4 Point-of-care testing Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway ( 2C). Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and performance of the device, including external quality assessment, and theinterpretation of the result is used. Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the equation consistent with that used within the region. Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices to produce a positive result in 85% of people with signi ﬁcant albuminuria (ACR $30 mg/g or $3 mg/mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device. Chapter 2. Risk assessment in people with CKD 2.1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories Practice Point 2.1.1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD. Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeut ic decisions. Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of >30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. (Continued on following page )KDIGO executive conclusions A Levin et al.: Executive summary of KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline 688 Kidney International (2024) 105, 684–701 complications of CKD is incrementally increased with worse categories of estimated GFR (eGFR) and albuminuria andinclude information using both updated eGFR equations forcreatinine alone, as well as those using creatinine and cystatinC combined. On this foundation of key concepts and inclusive framework, we now describe the key statements for each of the chapters. Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD This chapter highlights the importance of detecting CKDin high-risk populations because CKD is often silent andpatients may be asymptomatic at early stages. Thescreening algorithm for the diagnosis of CKD in adultshighlights the use of basic testing methods, and then details the importance of thorough evaluation for the cause and accurate assessment of GFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to appropriately stage peoplewith CKD. There are special considerations in pediatricpopulations and those with advanced age regardingscreening and staging. The evaluation of cause should bethorough, using all available information (clinical, social,and family history) and accessible testing (laboratory, imaging, genetics, and biopsy), given that etiology impacts prognosis, risk, and choice of therapies. Given that up to25% of all current CKD registries or study cohorts have“unknown etiology ”documented, there is renewed interestin enabling clinicians and people with CKD to under- stand, if possible, the cause of CKD. The chapter also reminds clinicians that the kidney has many functions (excretory, endocrine, and metabolic) andthat GFR is one component of excretory function. Under-standing the best methods by which to evaluate GFR andwhen to use estimating equations versus direct measurementsis highlighted. The recommendations to use the most accurate, validated equations to estimate GFR, preferably with a combination ofserum creatinine and cystatin C, are important. From both apatient and provider perspective, acknowledging that serumcreatinine –based equations have limitations that can be overcome with the use of an additional marker (cystatin C) isnotable and places a high value on accuracy and lower valueon resource utilization associated with the additional biomarker. The chapter describes the value of using a com- bined creatinine and cystatin C –based equation in speci ﬁc situations. Table 2 highlights clinical circumstances where this might apply. 7–23As we acquire more knowledge and data about GFR estimating equations using cystatin C versuscreatinine or both, there are now recognized implications ofthose differences that need to be understood by clinicians, inboth direction and magnitude. There are issues related to how best to estimate GFR in transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary individuals where aTable 1 | (Continued) Chapter 2. Risk assessment in people with CKD Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation. 2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3 –G5, we recommend using an externally validated risk equation to estimate the absolute risk of kidney failure ( 1A). Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% –5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of >40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinic al considerations. Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3 –G5, may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1 –G2. Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speci ﬁc, externally validated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). 2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with CKD Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use externally validated models that are either developed within CKD populations or that incorporate eGFR and albuminuria. Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validated models that predict all-caus e mortality speci ﬁcally developed in the CKD population.

The calcu- lation of estimated GFR by creatinine and cystatin C usingeither sex constant may be impacted by non-GFR de-terminants of creatinine, and a holistic approach should be taken to determine appropriate management anchored to the muscle mass of the individual and based on their sex hor-mone con ﬁguration and gender identity. Similarly, cystatin C–based equations may be affected by gender hormone – afﬁrming therapy. The assessment of gender in the context of eGFR is therefore an area for shared decision-making andan evolving area for investigation. Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions (e.g., oncology drug dosing, kidney donor eligibility, etc.), clinicians are encouraged to measure GFR byestablished clearance methods of glomerular ﬁltration markers (Table 3 ). The chapter addresses and reinforces key points for clinical laboratories including the implementation of laboratorystandards for reporting, the use of enzymatic assays instead ofJaffe method for creatinine measurements (given the inter- ference of many drugs and substances when using the latter), timing of processing of blood samples, and simultaneousmeasurement of creatinine and cystatin C on the same bloodsample. These are all intended to improve consistency andcomparability of laboratory values. The chapter also recommends using validated GFR esti- mating equations that should be the same within geographicalregions so that people with CKD and healthcare providers (HCPs) have access to the same information, derived using the same methodology. The evaluation of albuminuria is also addressed in this chapter, so that clinicians are aware and understand the de-terminants of albuminuria measurements, which will enablebetter interpretation and guide action. Given the established,consistent strong relationship between the quantity of urinealbumin with both kidney disease and CVD risk, clinicians are encouraged to pay attention to this measurement. Albu- minuria measurements may not be available in all regions,and proteinuria is not the same as albuminuria; clinicians should appreciate those differences. There are factors thatinﬂuence variability in urine albumin or protein measures, as there are different ones that impact urine creatinine. Given that the ratios are used to ascertain risk, understanding sources of both analytical and biological variability isimportant for the interpretation of ﬂuctuations in urine ACR. The use of point-of-care testing may facilitate access to earlier diagnosis and care and can be implemented in ruraland remote locations. The value of point-of-care testing forcurrently underserved populations cannot be overstated andshould include the capacity for generating creatinine-based eGFR equations. The point-of-care testing devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and urine foralbumin and creatinine to measure ACR and be standardizedand calibrated with similar rigor as is recommended forlaboratory tests. Overall, this chapter presents statements that help HCPs to fully evaluate people with the diagnosis of CKD and providesdata to aid the clinicians and the laboratories to understand and appreciate nuances of evaluating the common tests for assessing GFR and albuminuria, and aims to aid in increasingaccuracy of risk assessments to guide therapeutic decision-making. Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD This chapter addresses the need to monitor the progression ofCKD using both blood and urine tests on a regular basis,informed by risk of the individual, and contextualized withinhealthcare system capacity. It provides guidance for bothmonitoring and the interpretation of changes over time thatmay prompt additional testing or evaluation. There is anexpected variability in GFR and urine ACR caused by bothbiological and analytical factors of the biomarkers used, and nuances regarding changes with the initiation of therapies and when/how to further evaluate are also offered. Importantly, this chapter recommends the use of validated risk equations to estimate the “absolute ”risk of kidney fail- ure for individual people and offers thresholds by which todetermine referral timing of multidisciplinary care, modalityeducation, and preparation for transition to kidney replace-ment therapy, either dialysis or transplantation. The differ- entiation of “relative risks ”as presented in the heatmaps in the introductory chapter and individual risks, as calculatedusing these risk equations, is critical in the context ofimproving communication between people with CKD andHCPs, as well as planning for transitions in care, healthcaresystem resource utilization, and potentially for enrollmentinto clinical trials. It is noted that there are disease-speci ﬁc tools (for immunoglobulin A nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease) and evolving tools for predicting events and mortality in people with CKD. In the era of precisionmedicine, the use of validated prediction tools will help tailorthe frequency of visits, bloodwork, timing of educationalTable 3 | Indications for measured glomerular ﬁltration rate Clinical conditions in which eGFRcr-cys is inaccurate or uncertain due to potential non-GFR determinants of creatinine and cystatin C. This may include catabolic states, such as serious infections or in ﬂammatory states, high cell turnover as in some cancers, advanced cirrhosis or heartfailure, use of high-dose steroids, or the very frail.

Chapter 3: Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive discussion of the totality of treatment strategies required to reduce the risk of bothprogression of CKD and its attendant comorbidities ( Table 4 ). Lifestyle factors that include optimizing physical activity and weight, the avoidance of tobacco products, as well as access to trained individuals (renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, psychologists, and others)are highlighted, with the evidence to support those activities presented. It is noted that those with speci ﬁc needs (children or frail [older] adults) should have lifestyle counseling basedon capability and values. There is an extensive review of diets now recommended for people with CKD, including plant-based diets, and proteinintake in accordance with needs and status. The importanceof not restricting protein in those who are cachexic, sarco-penic, or undernourished is highlighted. Avoidance of high-protein intake and the need for close supervision if very low – protein intake is attempted are all described in detail, again,underscoring the importance of individualization of care Healthy diet Weight managementStop use of tobacco products Physical activity SGLT2i continue until dialysis or transplantAim for SBP <120 mm Hg RAS inhibitor* at maximum tolerated dose (if HTN)Statin-based therapy moderate- or high-intensity statin Manage hyperglycemia as per the KDIGO Diabetes Guideline, including use of GLP-1 RA where indicatedUse ns-MRA in people with diabetes and an indication for useDihydropyridine CCB and/or diuretic if needed to achieve individualized BP targetAntiplatelet agent for clinical ASCVDASCVD risk, lipids BPLifestyle First-line drug therapy for most patients+ Targeted therapies for complications Steroidal MRA if needed for resistant hypertension if eGFR ≥45Ezetimibe, PCSK9i indicated based on ASCVD risk and lipidsManage anemia, CKD-MBD, acidosis, and potassium abnormalities, where indicated Use the same principles to diagnose and manage ASCVD and atrial fibrillation as in people without CKD Regular risk factor reassessment (every 3–6 months) Figure 2 | Holistic approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment and risk modi ﬁcation. *Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker should be ﬁrst-line therapy for blood pressure (BP) control when albuminuria is present, otherwise dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) or diuretic can also be considered; all 3 classes are often needed to attain BP targets.

Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications 3.1 CKD treatment and risk modi ﬁcation Practice Point 3.1.1: Treat people with CKD with a comprehensive treatment strategy to reduce risks of progression of CKD and its associated complications (Figure 17a). 3.2 Lifestyle factors Practice Point 3.2.1: Encourage people with CKD to undertake physical activity compatible with cardiovascular health, tolerance, and level of frai lty; achieve an optimal body mass index (BMI); and not to use tobacco products. Referral to providers and programs (e.g., psychologists, renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapy, and smoking cessation programs) should be offered where indicat ed and available. 3.2.1 Avoiding use tobacco products [No speci ﬁc recommendations or practice points] 3.2.2 Physical activity and optimum weight Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that people with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D) . Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical activity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of other comorbidities, and acces st o resources. Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior.Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensity of physical activity (low, mo derate, or vigorous) and the type of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both). Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight.Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD to undertake physical activity aiming for World Health Organization (WHO)-advised levels (i.e .,$60 minutes daily) and to achieve a healthy weight. 3.3 Diet Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal- based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about dietary adaptations regarding sodium , phosphorus, potassium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions. 3.3.1 Protein intake Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with CKD G3 –G5(2C). Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression. Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, consider prescribing, under close supervisi on, a very low –protein diet (0.3 –0.4 g/kg body weight/d) supplemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kg body weight/d). Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low –protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD. Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake in children with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The target protein and energy intake i n children with CKD G2 –G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth. Older adults Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlying conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higher protein and calorie dietary targ ets. 3.3.2 Sodium intake Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD (2C). Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy.Special considerations Pediatric considerationsPractice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based Recommended Daily Intake when counseling about sodium intake for children with CKD who have systolic and/ or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height. 3.4 Blood pressure control Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of ﬁce BP measurement (2B). Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures, very limited life expect ancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension. Special considerations Pediatric considerations Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to £50th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C). Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3 –6 months with standardized auscultatory of ﬁce BP in children with CKD.

Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatory of ﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol- driven standardized setting, of 50th –75th percentile for age, sex, and height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension. 3.5 Glycemic control Please refer to the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease24for speci ﬁc recommendations, practice points, and research recommendations. 3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) f or people with CKD and moderately increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB ) for people with CKD and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should b e administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve the bene ﬁts described because the proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses. Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinin e, and serum potassium sh ould be checked within 2 –4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia a ssociated with use of RASi can often be managed by me asures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or AR B therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30 % within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albu minuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for speci ﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people wit h CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. 3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A) . Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reason able to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,u n l e s si t is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of pro longed fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating ad ults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A) : /C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for adults with T2D, an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2,normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A). Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies. Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults.Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select people with consistently normal serum potassium concentration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA (Figure 26 b). Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts. Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly among people with a low GFR. 3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, or who are unable to use those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B). Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene ﬁts.

Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications 3.10 Metabolic acidosis Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the uppe r limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or ﬂuid status. 3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD 3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium measurement Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of potassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and mechanisms that may in ﬂuence potassium measurement including diurnal and seasonal variation, plasma versus serum samples, and the actions of medications. 3.11.2 Potassium exchange agents Practice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologic management of nonemergent hyperkalemia. 3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moderate and severe hyperkalemia in adults [No speci ﬁc recommendations or practice points] 3.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia [No speci ﬁc recommendations or practice points] 3.11.5 Dietary considerations Practice Point 3.11.5.1: Implement an individualized approach in people with CKD G3 –G5 and emergent hyperkalemia that includes dietary and pharmacologic interventions and takes into consideration associated comorbidities and quality of life (QoL). Assessment and education through a r enal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider are advised. Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3 –G5 who have a history of hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern. 3.12 Anemia Please refer to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease publications for speci ﬁc recommendations, selection, and dosing of speci ﬁc therapeutic agents, and research recommendations. 3.13 CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) Please refer to the KDIGO 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease –Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD )for speci ﬁc recommendations, selection, dosing of speci ﬁc therapeutic agents, and research recommendations. 3.14 Hyperuricemia Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid –lowering intervention ( 1C). Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid –lowering therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout (particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is >9 mg/dl [535 mmol/l]). Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia.Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferabl et o nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syru p intake. Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression ( 2D). 3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional speci ﬁc interventions to modify risk 3.15.1 Lipid management Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged ‡50 years with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a –G5), we recommend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination ( 1A). Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged ‡50 years with CKD and eGFR ‡60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR categories G1 –G2), we recommend treatment with a statin ( 1B). Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18 –49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the following ( 2A): /C15known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), /C15diabetes mellitus, /C15prior ischemic stroke, or /C15estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction >10% . Practice Point 3.15.1.1: Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool.Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) chol esterol to achieve the largest treatment bene ﬁts. (Continued on following page )A Levin et al.: Executive summary of KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline KDIGO executive conclusions Kidney International (2024) 105, 684–701 695 plans based on the best evidence for different people at different points in their kidney journey. Salt intake and blood pressure management are concordant with other guidancedocuments, and again caveats for targets in vulnerable or frailpopulations are highlighted. Measurements using 24-hourambulatory devices are underscored, as is the interpretationof those readouts for children. Recommendations for using renin-angiotensin system in- hibitors, where tolerated, in those with and without diabetes and in those with moderately high urine albumin excretion are clearly articulated, as is the value of these medications inthe context of heart failure and CKD. Guidance for reductionor cessation of medication for those intolerant (due to sideeffects or hypotension) is offered, as are reassurances as towhen to maintain people on these agents despite changes inbloodwork (serum creatinine, potassium, etc.). There is an abundance of literature on which to base guidance on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to both delay CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular complications. Nu-ances for those with and without diabetes, heart failure, andfor those with higher and lower urine ACR levels are clearlyarticulated. Guidance for the use of mineralocorticoid an-tagonists (both steroidal and nonsteroidal) is also offered,given their value in blood pressure management, heart failuretreatment, and delay of progression of CKD in those with and without diabetes. The treatment of metabolic acidosis to delay progression of CKD has not been proven; however, it is recognized thatacidosis can lead to exacerbation of nutritional issues(anorexia and protein wasting), bone disease, and other consequences. These can be addressed with both dietary in- terventions and medications. Suggestions to evaluate the risk-beneﬁt ratio and goals of therapy are described, and the threshold for aggressive intervention has been moved to <18 mmol/l from <22 mmol/l in the previous KDIGO guideline. Hyperkalemia is discussed in terms of frequency of occurrence, “expected ”values for potassium at different levels of GFR, and treatment strategies, which highlight newer at- titudes toward dietary advice (avoidance of highly processed foods, but not of fruits and vegetables), an improved under-standing of different factors that impact potassium, and tar-geted therapy based on thorough assessment and context. Newer data on the value of treating hyperuricemia were evaluated. No data were found to support targeting hyper-uricemia in the absence of symptoms (e.g., gout or tophiformation). The treatment of common laboratory abnormalities of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, and phosphate followscurrent KDIGO guideline documents on these speci ﬁc en- tities. Importantly, tables are provided describing “expected ” values for common laboratory tests by eGFR so that cliniciansmay be able to better identify aberrant values that requireadditional work-up or review. A section on cardiovascular risk factor modi ﬁcation for both atherosclerotic disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) and atrial ﬁbrillation is offered whereby speci ﬁc interventions are highlighted and calculation of risk scores promoted to guide initiation or modi ﬁcation ofTable 4 | (Continued) Recommendations and practice points from Chapter 3 of the KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for Evaluation and Management of CKD Chapter 3. Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications Practice Point 3.15.1.3: In adults with CKD aged 18 –49, a lower (i.e., <10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also be appropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-based therapy. Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors to people with CKD who have an ind ication for their use. Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based “Mediterranean-style ”diet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular disease events (i.e., secondary prevention) in people with CKD and established ischemic cardiovascular disease ( 1C). Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance. 3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary artery disease Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable stress-test con ﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an initial conservative approach using intensive medical therapy is an appropriate alternative to an initial invasive strategy ( 2D). Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an invasive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKD with acute or unstable coronary dis ease, unacceptable levels of angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left ventricular systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main dise ase. 3.16 CKD and atrial ﬁbrillation Practice Point 3.16.1: Follow established strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation (Figure 40c). Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of non –vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial ﬁbrillation in people with CKD G1 –G4 ( 1C). Practice Point 3.16.2: NOAC dose adjustment for GFR is required, with caution needed at CKD G4 –G5. Practice Point 3.16.3: Duration of NOAC discontinuation before elective procedures needs to consider procedural bleeding risk, NOAC prescribed, a nd level of GFR (Figure 44d).

The use of statins, antiplatelet therapy, and invasive versus intensive medical therapy is addressed in detail, citingand interpreting an extensive evidence base. The chapter emphasizes the need to evaluate people with CKD comprehensively in order to address both progressive CKD and its attendant comorbidities in an integrated mannerand draws on literature to support this holistic approach(Figure 2 24). Chapter 4: Medical management and drug stewardship in CKD This chapter reminds HCPs and people with CKD about the importance of assessing medications in the context of GFR,and given that GFR changes over time, it emphasizes the needfor and value of regular reassessment ( Table 5 ). Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows need to be dosed according to the most accurate assessment of GFR, which may requiredirect measurement. Understanding of drug metabolism and excretion is poor in speci ﬁc patient groups (children and in persons of child- bearing age), and the impact of concomitant hormonaltherapy (for any reason, in male or female individuals) is notknown. Thus, we should proceed with caution and ensure that we gather more data in these areas to better inform care for diverse individuals across the life spectrum. Chapter 4 also promotes the concepts of recognizing the risks of polypharmacy, the potential value of deprescribing,and the need for good drug stewardship, both for peoplewith CKD as well as providers. Accessible education andcommunication for people with CKD will support efforts athealth literacy but also potentially mitigate issues of non- adherence. Given the very large number of drugs that peoplewith CKD are prescribed, this is an important component of care, ensuring that people are prescribed the right drugs forthe right reasons at the right dose. Lastly, the chapter highlights new literature that suggests that intravenous contrast does not carry large risks in people with CKD and that imaging studies should be performedbased on information they provide and how and if they willchange management. The true low risk of associated acutekidney injury is highlighted and will require ongoing edu-cation of all HCPs and people with CKD to enable appro-priate timely diagnostic imaging. Chapter 5: Optimal models of care This chapter addresses the value of referral to nephrologyspecialists for comprehensive evaluation and work-up and the importance of access to multidisciplinary care teams, while recognizing the associated cost(s) and the nonavail-ability of multidisciplinary care teams in different regions(Table 5 ). There is an emphasis on standardized regular assessment of symptoms, and the use of validated ques-tionnaires to help both people with CKD and HCPsappreciate changes over time and the impact of symptommanagement ( Figure 3 ). The need for planned and extended transitions from pe- diatric to adult care is highlighted, as is the importance of trueteam-based care models. The value of supportive care andcomprehensive conservative management is described forthose who choose not to or who cannot access kidneyreplacement therapy. The use of technology, digital platforms,and tools, including, but not limited to, virtual care, to helpteams and individuals access the totality of the value of the team and resources is described.

Medication management and drug stewardship in CKD 4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. When prescribing such medications to people with CKD, always consider the bene ﬁts versus potential harms. Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and therapeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people with CKD receiving medications wit h narrow therapeutic windows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity, both in outpatient practice and in hospital settings. Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the-counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that may be harmful for people with CKD.Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications to people with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, always review teratogenicity potential a nd provide regular reproductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance with the values and preferences of the person with CKD. 4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys. Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings, validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate for drug dosing.Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), dru g toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use of equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measuredGFR may be indicated. Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of body weight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) may be indicated, especially for medication s with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentration to be effective. Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state. 4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship Practice Point 4.3.1: Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence, continued indication, and po tential drug interactions because people with CKD often have complex medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists. Practice Point 4.3.2: If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when to restart the discontinued medicati ons to the affected person and healthcare providers, and ensure documentation in the medical record. Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation of medications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i) in the 48 –72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary measure to prevent complications. However, note that failure to restartthese medications after the event or procedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point 4.3.2). 4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected bene ﬁts and possible risks of medications so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed. Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationships with other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/or use tools to ensure and impr ove drug stewardship in people with CKD to enhance management of their complex medication regimens. 4.4 Imaging studies Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imaging studies in accordance with general population indications. Risks and bene ﬁts of imaging studies should be determined on an individual basis in the context of their CKD. 4.4.1 Radiocontrast: intra-arterial and intravenous dye studies Practice Point 4.4.1.1: Assess the risk for AKI in people with CKD receiving intra-arterial contrast for cardiac procedures using validated tools.Practice Point 4.4.1.2: The intravenous administration of radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance with consensus statements from the radiology societies in people with AKI or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(CKD G3a –G5) undergoing elective investigation. 4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast media Practice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2(CKD G4 –G5) who require gadolinium-containing contrast media, preferentially offer them American Colleague of Radiology group II and III gadolinium-based contrast agents. Chapter 5. Optimal models of care 5.1 Referral to specialist kidney care services Practice Point 5.1.1: Refer adults with CKD to specialist kidney care services in the circumstances listed in Figure 48.a Special considerations Pediatric considerations Practice Point 5.1.2: Refer children and adolescents to specialist kidney care services in the following circumstances: /C15an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol) OR a PCR of 200 mg/g (20 mg/mmol) or more, con ﬁrmed on a repeat ﬁrst morning void sample, when well and not during menstruation, /C15persistent hematuria, /C15any sustained decrease in eGFR, /C15hypertension, /C15kidney out ﬂow obstruction or anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, /C15known or suspected CKD, or /C15recurrent urinary tract infection. 5.2 Symptoms in CKD 5.2.1 Prevalence and severity of symptoms [No speci ﬁc recommendations or practice points] (Continued on following page )KDIGO executive conclusions A Levin et al.: Executive summary of KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline 698 Kidney International (2024) 105, 684–701 Table 5 | (Continued) Chapter 5. Optimal models of care 5.2.2 Identi ﬁcation and assessment of symptoms Practice Point 5.2.2.1: Ask people with progressive CKD about uremic symptoms (e.g., reduced appetite, nausea, and level of fatigue/lethargy) at ea ch consultation using a standardized validated assessment of uremic symptoms tool. 5.2.3 Management of common symptoms for people with CKD Practice Point 5.2.3.1: Use evidence-informed management strategies to support people to live well with CKD and improve their health-related quali ty of life. Practice Point 5.2.3.2: Screen people with CKD G4 –G5, aged >65, poor growth (pediatrics), or symptoms such as involuntary weight loss, frailty, or poor appetite twice annually for malnutrition using a validated assessment tool. Practice Point 5.2.3.3: Enable availability of appropriate medical nutrition therapy for people with signs of malnutrition, ideally under the supe rvision of renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers if not available. 5.3 Team-based integrated care Practice Point 5.3.1: Enable access to a patient-centered multidisciplinary care team consisting of dietary counseling, medication management, education, and counseling about different KRT modalities, transplant options, dialysis access surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social ca re for people with CKD. Practice Point 5.3.2: Education programs that also involve care partners where indicated are important to promote informed, activated people with C KD. Practice Point 5.3.3: Consider the use of telehealth technologies including web-based, mobile applications, virtual visiting, and wearable devic es in the delivery of education and care. Special considerations Pediatric considerations 5.3.1 Transition from pediatric to adult care 5.3.1.1 Pediatric providersPractice Point 5.3.1.1.1: Prepare adolescents and their families for transfer to adult-oriented care starting at 11 –14 years of age by using checklists to assess readiness and guide preparation, and by conducting part of each visit without the parent/guardian present (Figure 55 b). Practice Point 5.3.1.1.2: Provide a comprehensive written transfer summary, and ideally an oral handover, to the receiving healthcare providers in cluding all relevant medical information as well as information about the young person ’s cognitive abilities and social support (Figure 55b). Practice Point 5.3.1.1.3: Transfer young people to adult care during times of medical and social stability where possible. 5.3.1.2 Adult providers Practice Point 5.3.1.2.1: Recognize that young people under 25 years of age with CKD are a unique population at high risk for adverse outcomes at least i n part due to physiologic incomplete brain maturation. Practice Point 5.3.1.2.2: Encourage young people to informally visit the adult care clinic to which they will be transferred before the ﬁrst appointment (Figure 55b). Practice Point 5.3.1.2.3: Assess young people with CKD more frequently than older people with the same stage of CKD and, with the agreement of the young person, include the caregivers or signi ﬁcant other of the young person in their care, at least in the ﬁrst 1 –3 years following transfer from pediatric care (Figure 55b). 5.4 Timing the initiation of dialysis Practice Point 5.4.1: Initiate dialysis based on a composite assessment of a person ’s symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences, level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities. Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one or more of the following situations is evident (Table 41c). This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults when the GFR is <15–20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or risk of KRT is >40% over 2 years. Special considerations Pediatric considerations Practice Point 5.4.4: In children, in addition to the adult indications for dialysis, poor growth refractory to optimized nutrition, growth hormone , and medical management is an indication for initiating KRT. Practice Point 5.4.5: Pursue living or deceased donor preemptive kidney transplantation as the treatment of choice for children in whom there is evidence of progressive and irreversible CKD. The eGFR at which preemptive transplantation should be undertaken will depend on multiple factorsincluding the age and size of the child and the rate of progression of kidney failure but will usually be between eGFR 5 –15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. 5.5 Structure and process of supportive care and comprehensive conservative management Practice Point 5.5.1: Inform people with CKD about the options for KRT and comprehensive conservative care. Practice Point 5.5.2: Support comprehensive conservative management as an option for people who choose not to pursue KRT.Practice Point 5.5.3: Provide access to resources that enable the delivery of advanced care planning for people with a recognized need for end-of-lif e care, including those people undergoing comprehensive conservative care.

There is an emphasis on advanced care planning, directed speciﬁcally to those choosing supportive care, but also recognizing that all people with chronic diseases do need to ensure that plans addressing future healthcare states areknown to all. Conclusion Research recommendations are offered in the last chapter insome detail to signpost priority areas for the ﬁeld, such as improving diagnostic and dynamic tests of kidney health and disease, improving and evaluating the implementation of validated prediction equations in speci ﬁc situations, and testing different combinations of disease-modifying drugswith dietary regimens, to name but a few. This comprehensive guidance document based on current best evidence indicates some exciting new approaches tomanagement strategies and treatment options for peopleliving with CKD, with the goal of improving symptom management, disease modi ﬁcation, and offering person- centered approaches, while also recognizing the heterogene-ity of CKD. The fact that new therapies exist and others arebeing evaluated heralds an exciting time for people living withkidney diseases, their families, and the HCP .
