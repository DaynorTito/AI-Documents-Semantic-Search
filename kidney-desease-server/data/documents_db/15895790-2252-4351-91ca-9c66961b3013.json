We sought to determine, retrospectively, whether obesity was associated with adverse renal outcomes in 17,630 patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 1995 through December 2006. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥30 kg /m2. The primary outcome was any episode of postoperative renal insufficiency (requiring or not requiring dialysis) before hospital discharge. Outcomes were evaluated in the entire cohort and in subgroups undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), isolated valve surgery, and combined CABG and valve surgery. The final analysis included 16,429 patients, 5,124 (31%) of whom were obese. In the entire cohort, obesity was associated both with increased risk of any postoperative renal insufficiency (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–1.55) and with in - creased risk of renal insufficiency not requiring dialysis (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23–1.62). Obe - sity was associated with an increased risk of postoperative renal insufficiency in patients undergoing isolated CABG (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18–1.61), isolated valve surgeries (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05–1.85), and combined CABG and valve surgeries (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.99–1.83; statistically nonsignificant). Development of postoperative renal insufficiency was associated with a significantly higher mortality rate (P <0.0001) and with a significantly longer hospital stay (23 vs 10.5 days; P <0.0001). We conclude that obesity is associated with a significant increase in postoperative renal insufficiency in cardiac surgery patients, an effect that we attribute to an increase in post - operative renal failure that does not require dialysis. (Tex Heart Inst J 2009;36(6):540-5) Obesity is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease.1-6 It has also been shown to be associated, in patients who have chronic kidney dis - ease, with increased oxidative stress and inflammation,1 impairment of renal endothelial function,2,3 and proteinuria.4,5 Inflammation appears to be an important mediator in the development of postoperative renal failure.6,7 Although epidemiologic data indicate that obesity might be associated with the development of chronic kidney disease in the general population,8-10 there are very few studies pertaining to obesity as an independent predictor of poor renal outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac sur - geries. In most of these studies,6,7,11-15 the occurrence of postoperative renal insufficien - cy has not been the primary outcome; moreover, the results have been inconsistent. We lack firm data on whether obesity is associated with an increase in the severity of postoperative renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine whether obesity is an independent predictor of postoperative renal insufficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries, including patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), isolated valve surgeries, and combined CABG and valve surgeries. We also investigated the possible association between obesity and increased severity of postoperative renal failure (that is, postoperative renal failure requiring in-hospital dialysis). Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 17 ,630 consecutive patients who un - derwent surgical procedures (CABG, valve surgery, or both) at St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital from 1 January 1995 through 31 December 2006.

Texas Heart Institute Journal Obesity and Postoperative Renal Failure 541from the analysis 1,038 patients who underwent any associated procedures, including left ventricular aneu - rysm repair and ascending aortic repairs, and another 163 patients who experienced preoperative renal failure requiring dialysis. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board. The remaining 16,429 patients were divided into 2 groups (obese and nonobese) on the basis of body mass index (BMI). Obesity was defined as a BMI of ≥30 kg/ m 2 (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Patients’ weights at admission to the hospital were used to calculate BMI. Patients’ baseline charac - teristics and intraoperative variables were obtained from the Texas Heart Institute Research Database (THIRD - Base). This database had written documentation for each field coded. Data from patient charts were ab - stracted by 3 trained abstractors, with 95% agreement among abstractors. Monthly electronic quality-control checks were conducted to catch logical errors. When verification coding (recoding the same admission) was performed on a minimum of 10 admissions per month, it found that 95% of the data collected was correct. The variables used for our analysis included age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior myocar - dial infarction, preoperative renal insufficiency, hyper - lipidemia, unstable angina, peripheral vascular disease, transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accident, low left ventricular ejection fraction (defined as <0.35), need for urgent or repeat surgery, need for an intra- aortic bal - loon pump, New York Heart Association class at the time of surgery, and aortic cross-clamp time. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of any postoperative renal insufficiency up to the time of the patient’s discharge from index hospitalization for cardiac surgery. Postoperative renal insufficiency was defined as the occurrence of acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, postoperative anuria, or any increase in serum creatinine deemed clinically signifi - cant by the treating physician. Postoperative renal in - sufficiency was subdivided into renal failure requiring any dialysis session during the hospitalization and renal failure not requiring dialysis. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statisti - cal software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.; Cary, NC). Baseline characteristics and intraoperative variables were compared in both patient groups. Differences between groups were evaluated by the c 2 test for discrete variables and the t test for continuous variables. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multivariate lo - gistic regression model was used to control for potential confounders and to ascertain which variables were in - dependently associated with outcome. Variables used in the multivariate logistic regression model included all the preoperative and intraoperative variables. Because it can be argued that obese patients on av - erage were sicker and had a higher risk of developing postoperative renal insufficiency when compared with nonobese patients, we attempted to minimize this se - lection bias by performing propensity-score matching. 16 Propensity scores were estimated using uncondition - al logistic regression to determine the predicted proba - bility of obesity for each patient. The variables used in the model after propensity-score matching are shown in Table I. Obese patients and nonobese patients were then matched 1-to-1 on the basis of these variables, re - sulting in successful matching of 6,866 patients (3,433 patients in each group). All predictor variables were then TABLE I.

Results The final study population consisted of 16,429 patients. Of these, 11,830 (72%) patients had isolated CABG, 3,062 (19%) had isolated valve surgeries, and 1,537 (9%) had combined CABG and valve surgeries. A total of 5,124 patients (31%) had a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2. In this obese cohort, 3,414 patients (63%) had a BMI between 30 and 34.99 kg/m 2, 1,189 patients (23%) had a BMI between 35 and 39.99 kg/m2, and 521 patients (10%) had a BMI ≥40 kg/m2. Preoperative characteristics of obese and nonobese patients are compared in Table II. In the obese group, there were more women than men. Obese patients had a higher prevalence o f hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and unstable angina, and had longer total bypass times. Nonobese patients were older, had a higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease and transient ischemic attacks, and underwent more repeat operations when compared with obese patients. In the entire cohort, 1,437 patients (9%) had the primary outcome of postoperative renal insufficiency. Variables independently associated with the occurrence of postoperative renal insufficiency in the entire cohort are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Table III, obesity in the entire cohort was independently associated with a 37% increase in the risk of developing any postoper - ative renal insufficiency (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–1.55), and this risk was mostly attributable to an increase in renal insufficiency not requiring dialysis (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23–1.62).

Within these subgroups, the in - creased risk was attributable to the increase in renal in - sufficiency not requiring dialysis. Patients who developed postoperative renal failure had a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate (25% vs 2.9%; P <0.001) and significantly prolonged length of hospital stay (mean, 23 days), when compared with patients who did not develop any postoperative renal in - sufficiency (mean, 10.5 days; P <0.0001). A higher risk for the development of postoperative renal insufficiency was associated with increasing sever - ity of obesity. For the BMI categories of 30 to 34.99 kg/m 2, 35 to 39.99 kg/m2, and ≥40 kg/m2, the percentag - es of patients who developed postoperative renal failure were 9.2%, 11.1%, and 13.1%, respectively ( P=0.001 for the trend). Patient characteristics independently associated with the risk of postoperative renal insufficiency after pro - pensity-score matching for obesity status are shown in Figure 2.

Volume 36, Number 6 , 2009 544 Obesity and Postoperative Renal FailureDiscussion In this retrospective cohort analysis of 16,429 consecu - tive cases, we found that obesity was associated with a significant increase in postoperative renal insufficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries. This effect—seen in the entire cohort, as well as in patients under - going isolated CABG or isolated valve surgeries—was attributable mostly to an increase in postoperative renal failure that did not require dialysis. The risk was graded with the increasing risk that is associated with an increase in the severity of obesity. The development of postop - erative renal insufficiency was associated with a signif - icantly higher mortality rate and with a longer length of stay. Obesity is associated with oxidative stress and endo - thelial dysfunction. 1 Obese patients are at a higher risk of developing hypertensio n17 and diabetes,18 which are also associated with elevated inflammatory response and impaired endothelial function. 16,17 The use of car - diopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgeries has been shown to be associated with an up-regulation of the in - flammatory cascade. 19,20 This, together with the preva - lence of risk factors associated with the development of postoperative renal insufficiency and the risk associated with obesity itself, means that obese patients may have a higher incidence of postoperative renal insufficiency. Although epidemiologic studies have shown that obe - sity is independently associated with the development of chronic kidney disease, 8-10,21-23 studies of the association between obesity and the development of postoperative renal insufficiency have yielded disparate results. 6,7,11-15,24,25 Moulton and colleague s13 did not find an association between obesity and postoperative renal failure, but an analysis of data from the Society o f Thoracic Sur - geons’ database by Prabhakar and associate s 12 showed that moderate obesity (BMI, 35–39.9 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) were independently associat - ed with the development of renal insufficiency in the postoperative period. The reasons for these varying re - sults may include the small sample sizes of some stud - ies. In addition, the development of renal insufficiency in surgical subgroups (especially isolated valve surgery and combined CABG and valve surgery) has not been well studied. Our study is one of the first to specifical - ly evaluate the association between obesity and postop - erative renal outcomes in a very large cohort of patients who underwent cardiac surgeries. The risk estimates we obtained are comparable with those obtained in prior studies. 12,25 The risk estimate ob - tained by Prabhakar and associate s12 for patients with moderate obesity, defined as a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2, was 1.58 (1.50–1.67). We show that the presence of even mild forms of obesity (a BMI of 30 to 34.99 kg/m 2) was independently associated with the occurrence of postop - erative renal insufficiency and that patient cohorts with higher BMIs have higher incidences of postoperative renal insufficiency—which suggests a dose–response relationship. Most of the postoperative renal failure at - tributable to obesity did not require dialysis, but it was associated with a significantly longer hospital stay. Our findings extend the findings from earlier studie s 12,25 to show that obesity is associated also with an increased risk of renal insufficiency in subgroups that include pa - tients undergoing isolated CABG or isolated valve sur - geries. These subgroups have not been well studied before. The development of postoperative renal insufficien - cy is an important clinical event, because it is associated with an increase in death 26 and with prolonged stays in the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery.27 Our re - sults support some of these earlier findings and show that patients who develop renal failure in the postoper - ative setting have, on average, an 8-fold higher incidence of early postoperative death and twice the length of hos - pital stay, when compared with patients who do not de - velop postoperative renal insufficiency. Limitations Our study had limitations. Because we did not have postoperative serum creatinine measurements in our da - tabase, we used a clinical definition of renal failure as our outcome measure, which may have caused us to underestimate the true incidence of postoperative renal failure. However, the incidence of postoperative renal insufficiency in our cohort was comparable with those reported in prior studies of patients who had undergone cardiac surgery. 11 Furthermore, although we performed propensity-score matching to account for differences be - tween the obese and nonobese groups, it is possible that some unmeasured differences between the 2 groups are responsible for observed differences in outcomes. More - over, a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 may not be the most sensitive definition of obesity, and uniform BMI cutoffs may not apply across all races and ethnic groups. Other mea - sures, such as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ra - tios, might have provided a more accurate reading of the increased risk associated with obesity. 28 Although this was a single- institution study, the high volume of cases and the large, multiyear cohort likely enable the results to be applied, in general, to other settings; and the paucity of studies on this important topic lends in - terest to our findings, as well. Despite these limitations, the strengths of our study include carefully applied re - gression and propensity analyses. Conclusions Our results have important clinical implications. If the results of our retrospective review are confirmed in the setting of a randomized clinical trial, obesity as a risk factor for the development of postoperative renal insuf - ficiency could be viewed as modifiable. Indeed, in our Texas Heart Institute Journal Obesity and Postoperative Renal Failure 545multivariate analysis, obesity was one of the few modi - fiable risk factors for the development of postoperative renal failure . Carefully executed randomized clinical tri - als are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and to determine whether preventive measures—such as preoperative weight loss in selected patients not un - dergoing emergent or urgent procedures and the use of perioperative statin therapy (shown to be associat - ed with a decreased incidence of postoperative renal in - sufficienc y 29)—can ameliorate some of the detrimental renal outcomes that are associated with obesity in car - diac surgery patients.
