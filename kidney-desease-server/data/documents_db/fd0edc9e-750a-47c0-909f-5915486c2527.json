  "content": "Protein Microarrays Discover Angiotensinogen and PRKRIP1 as Novel Targets forAutoantibodies in Chronic Renal Disease Atul J. Butte‡§ /H20648, Tara K. Sigdel‡, Persis P. Wadia¶, David B. Miklos¶, and Minnie M. Sarwal‡§ Biomarkers for early detection of chronic kidney disease are needed, as millions of patients suffer from chronicdiseases predisposing them to kidney failure. Protein mi-croarrays may also hold utility in the discovery of auto-antibodies in other conditions not commonly consideredauto-immune diseases. We hypothesized that proteinsare released as a consequence of damage at a cellularlevel during end-organ damage from renal injury, not oth-erwise recognized as self-antigens, and an adaptive hu-moral immune response to these proteins might be de-tected in the blood, as a noninvasive tracker of this injury.The resultant antibodies (Ab) detected in the blood wouldserve as effective biomarkers for occult renal injury, ena-bling earlier clinical detection of chronic kidney diseasethan currently possible, because of the redundancy of theserum creatinine as a biomarker for early kidney injury. Toscreen for novel autoantibodies in chronic kidney disease,24 protein microarrays were used to compare serum Abfrom patients with chronic kidney disease againstmatched controls. From a panel of 38 antigens with in-creased Ab binding, four were validated in 71 individuals,with ( n/H1154950) and without ( n/H1154921) renal insufficiency. Significant elevations in the titer of novel auto-Ab werenoted against angiotensinogen and PRKRIP1 in renal in-sufficiency. Current validation is underway to evaluate ifthese auto-Ab can provide means to follow the evolutionof chronic kidney disease in patients with early stages ofrenal insufficiency, and if these rising titers of theseauto-Ab correlate with the rate of progression of chronickidney disease. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10: 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497, 1–8, 2011. Renal injury affects nearly a half-million patients in the United States and over a million people world-wide. Millionsof additional patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease(CKD) 1are at highest risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and those individuals diagnosed with diabe-tes or hypertension are at high risk for developing this dis-ease. The consequences of development of ESRD are severe,especially when progression occurs without early diagnosis.Early detection and initiation of potentially kidney-sparingtherapies, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitorsand angiotensin II receptor blockers, can offer significantbenefit to patients with renal injury (1, 2). Several markers have been discovered over the past few years that predict mortality in patients with ESRD on dialysis,including increased FGF-23 (3), /H9253-glutamyltransferase (4), N- terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (5), osteoprotegerin (6),and markers of protein-energy wasting (7). Neutrophil gelati-nase-associated lipocalin has been shown to be an earlymarker of progression from CKD to ESRD (8, 9). However,besides osteoprotegerin, few of these markers have demon-strated utility as candidates that predict worsening of kidneyfunction toward ESRD in patients without CKD. A chronic inflammatory state in renal injury and ESRD has been well described. C-reactive protein level, a broad markerof inflammation, is a strong predictor of mortality (10),whereas specific immune dysregulation, including dysfunc-tion of regulatory T cells, has been shown to be present inESRD (11). Levels of the inflammatory mediator long pentraxin3 have been shown to be increased in the serum of patientswith ESRD (12). Variants in genes coding for immune factors,including IL-10, have been associated with susceptibility toESRD (13). Given these studies, we hypothesized that we may be able to identify novel autoantibody biomarkers for CKD as it islikely that intracellular proteins are exposed as a consequenceof damage at a cellular level from end-organ damage fromchronic kidney disease. Given the increased inflammatorystate, we hypothesized that some of these released proteinsmight not normally be exposed to B cells undergoing devel-opment and are not otherwise recognized as self-antigens.We suspected that some of these proteins could be recog- From the ‡Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305; §Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital,725 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304; ¶Division of Bone MarrowTransplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Schoolof Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 Received May 14, 2010, and in revised form, December 15, 2010Published, MCP Papers in Press, December 23, 2010, DOI 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497 1The abbreviations used are: CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbentassay; AGT, angiotensinogen; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme.Research © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. This paper is available on line at http://www.mcponline.org Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10.3 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497–1 nized as antigenic, yielding an adaptive humoral immune re- sponse that could be detected in the blood in organ injury. To test our hypotheses and to screen for these putative auto-Ab responses, we used protein microarrays to screensera from patients with CKD and control individuals. Proteinmicroarrays have previously been used to identify tumor an-tigens ( 14), auto-antibody targets in rheumatologic and auto - immune disease ( 15), allo-antibodies in solid-organ transplan - tation ( 16), and potential markers for graft- versus -host disease. Rather than expecting a role for autoimmunity in renal injury, we suspected that the humoral immune responsecould serve as an amplifier for abnormal proteins exposed inthe end-organ damage. We therefore used protein microar-rays to detect the presence of auto-Ab in the sera of patientswith established renal insufficiency. In a first-stage analysis, we compared the serum antibodies from 17 patients with CKD with an estimated glomerular fil-tration rate /H1102130 ml/min/1.73m 2(17)(CKD stages 4 and 5) against seven age-matched healthy control individuals with normal renal function. We identified 38 candidate antigensshowing significantly higher antibody binding levels in pa-tients with CKD as compared with controls. We then testedfour of these antibodies (anti-AGT, Anti-PRKR1P1, anti-ATG7,and anti-DUSP26; p/H110210.005) in a second-stage, using inde- pendent sera obtained from 50 patients with CKD and 21 healthy age-matched controls. We found anti-angiotensino-gen (anti-AGT) autoAb ( p/H110210.001) and anti-PRKRIP1 autoAb (p/H110210.013) were significantly higher in patients with CKD, independent of etiology. Analysis of confounders for Ab signalshowed no impact of gender, age, race, CKD therapy, ororiginal diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Characteristics and Serum Processing— Approval was ob- tained from the Stanford Institutional Review Board for these studiesand individual informed consent for further studies was obtained fromall patients and donors. A 5.0 ml volume of blood was collected fromthe patients into a 5-ml cryotube and let stand at room temperaturefor at least 30 min. The serum was separated from the clot bycentrifuging at 2000 /H11003gusing a swinging bucket rotor and stored at /H1100280°C until use. Discovery Phase— Samples from 17 patients with CKD collected between August 2001 and April 2006, were included. Causes of renalinsufficiency in these patients related to reflux nephropathy ( n/H110054), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( n/H110054) and glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology ( n/H110059). Mean age of the patients at the time of sampling was 10.6 /H110065.4 (range 1–19 years). Twenty-four percent of patients were female. Samples from seven age-matched healthy con-trols were included. Protein Microarray Protocol— The ProtoArray® human protein mi- croarray V3 (Invitrogen, PAH052401) was used for profiling serum IgGinteractions with potential antigens. Each microarray contains 5056separate proteins printed in duplicate with N-terminal glutathione Stransferase (GST) epitopes expressed in Baculovirus and affinity pu-rified under native conditions maintaining their cellular enzymaticactivities/native conformations. Each protein was derived from theUltimate ORF collection (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Microarrays werestored at /H1100220 °C, equilibrated to 4 °C for 10 min before use, blockedfor 1 hour at 4 °C with sodium phosphate blocking buffer consisting of 100 m Msodium phosphate, 200 m MNaCl, 0.08% Triton X-100, 25% glycerol, 20 m Mreduced glutathione, and 1.0 m Mdithiothreitol at pH 7.4. All steps were carried out at /H110014 °C. Microarrays were then probed for 90 min with patient serum diluted 1/500 in phosphatebuffered saline-Tween (PBST) buffer consisting of 1 /H11003phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20at pH 7.4. Probing was followed by washing with PBST buffer fivetimes for 10 min each and then incubated for 90 min with goat anti-human IgG (H /H11001L) Alexa Fluor® 647 (Invitrogen, A21445). Microarrays were then washed again with PBST buffer five times for 10 min and thendipped briefly into ddH2O, prior to centrifugation for 1 min to dryness before scanning. The Axon GenePix 6.0 Scanner and Analyzer wereused to acquire microarray data. Slides were scanned at 635 nm with aPMT (Photomultiplier tubes) gain of 600, a laser power of 100% and afocus point of 0 /H9262m. The “.gal” files were obtained from a ProtoArray central portal on the Invitrogen website (www.invitrogen.com/ProtoArray) by submitting the barcode of each protein microarray. Statistical Analysis— Given that all samples were obtained from conditions not otherwise considered as auto-immune, spot intensitieson the protein microarrays were low, as expected. The average back-ground empty spot intensity across protein microarrays ranged from458 to 986, whereas maximum spot intensities across microarraysranged between 1002 and 2552. The median spot-to-spot Pearsoncorrelation across the 5056 noncontrol intensity measurements onthe protein microarrays was 0.40. Spot-to-spot Pearson correlationcoefficients were significantly linearly correlated with overall averageintensity measurements, with a linear regression model of correlationcoefficient /H11005/H110020.07/H110010.00061 *average intensity. Spots with average intensity measurements over 700 had average spot-to-spot Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35. Results calculated using spot-to-spotSpearman correlation coefficients were similar. Probes were selected from the 10,112 noncontrol spots on the protein microarrays, selecting for probes (1) showing a differentialincrease in mean intensity from control samples to CKD patientsamples of twofold or higher, (2) showing an uncorrected ttest p value/H113490.01, (3) with a mean intensity in healthy donor samples /H11349the mean empty spot intensity in those samples, and (4) with a meanintensity in renal insufficiency samples /H11350the mean empty spot inten- sity in those samples. This yielded only 42 (0.4%) significant probes.Probe identifiers were matched to Entrez Gene identifiers using AI-LUN ( 18), yielding 38 unique proteins. Four proteins were selected from these 38 based on prior biological knowledge on these proteins (see “Results”) and targeted for ELISA validation in independent CKDpatient and control serum. To estimate a false discovery rate, we randomly permuted the CKD and control labels for each of the 10,112 noncontrol spots, andrecalculated using the four criteria above. Across 100 shuffles, noneof the 10,112 spots met the criteria, leading us to estimate the falsediscovery rate at or below 0.01. As a first-pass assessment of intra-array technical variability, we separated the duplicate noncontrol spots from the 17 CKD patientsand made two synthetic control groups, with each group containing5056 spots and 17 CKD patients. Mirroring the four-step methodabove, we searched for probes showing a difference in mean intensitybetween the two groups of twofold higher or lower, an uncorrected t test pvalue /H113490.01, with a mean intensity in one group /H11349the mean empty spot intensity in those samples, and with a mean intensity inthe other group /H11350the mean empty spot intensity in those samples. Only 15 proteins met these control criteria, indicating probes withsignificant spot-to-spot variability. None of these 15 proteins over-lapped with the 38 proteins discovered above. For each of the 10,112 noncontrol spots, we tested whether the intensities measured at that spot across the seven control patientsAngiotensin Autoantibodies 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497–2 Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10.3 was normally distributed using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality as implemented in R. A total of 9346 spots (92%) had a pvalue /H113500.05 suggesting the null hypothesis of normal distribution would not berejected. Although the overall distribution of intensities on any onearray is clearly non-normal, our data would indicate that the distribu-tion of any one spot across a group of individuals could be viewed asnormally distributed. We found no statistically significant difference in overall max, mean, and sum of the noncontrol probes between control samplesand renal insufficiency sample protein microarrays. To be parsimoni-ous in methodology, our results were calculated without global nor-malization or scaling of microarrays. Even when each protein microar- ray was linearly scaled such that each probe measurement wasdivided by the sum of the overall intensity of each microarray, ourresults still held (though the pvalues were more significant). All statistics were performed in R version 2.9.Validation Phase— Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation for the candidate antibodies was performed on 71 inde-pendent serum samples obtained from 50 patients with CKD and 21healthy age- and gender-matched controls with no history of CKD.The validation CKD samples were selected from a pool of hundreds ofCKD patients enrolled in Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stan-ford over the past 5-year period. Our effort was to study CKD ingeneral that included several phenotypes of CKD. Of the 50 CKDsamples, 10 were from patients with aplastic, hypoplastic, or dys-plastic kidneys, 10 with obstructive uropathy, 10 with focal segmentalglomerulosclerosis, 8 with reflux nephropathy, 2 with idiopathic cres-centic glomerulonephritis, 2 with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodyvasculitis, and 1 each with vesicourethral reflux, type 1 mem-branoproliferative glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosusnephritis, C1Q nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cyto-plasmic antibody disease with an anti-glomerular basement mem-brane component, microscopic polyangiitis/pulmonary renal syn-drome, and interstitial nephritis. ELISA— An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was de- veloped to detect serum immunoglobulin binding to ATG7 (GenBankBC000091), AGT (BC011519), PRKRIP1 (BC014298), and DUSP26(NM 024025). We followed previously published protocol ( 19). In brief, insect-derived purified proteins fused to glutathione S-trans- ferase were acquired from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). A titration wasperformed to determine the optimal amount to be coated to becoated on to the immunosorbant 96-well plate (NUNC Brand,446612). Briefly, the 96-well microwell ELISA plates were coated withcorresponding protein in 50 /H9262l coating buffer (15 m MNa2CO3,3 0m M NaHCO3, 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Standard curves were generated using anti-GST tag (mouse mono- clonal IgG) (Millipore, Temecula, CA) and AP-conjugated AffiniPureGoat anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA).After washing the plates with tris buffered saline-Tween (TBST) bufferfive times, the nonspecific protein binding was blocked by 100 /H9262l, 2% dry milk in TBST buffer fo r1ha t room temperature. Following the blocking step, 50 /H9262l serum samples (40-fold diluted with 2% milk in TBST buffer) were incubated in the wells fo r1ha t room temperature. The plates were washed five times with TBST buffer and incubatedin 50 /H9262l AP-conjugated AffiniPure mouse anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The color was developed byusing AP-pNPP Liquid Substrate System for ELISA (Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, MO). Absorption was measured at 405 nm with aSPECTRAMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,CA). To control for nonspecific binding, wells with no proteins coatedwere served as negative controls. The mean absorbance resulted bysubtracting the negative control signal was used to calculate ttestp values. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were gener-ated from the ELISA data using ROCR ( 20).RESULTS To screen for putative auto-antibodies in patients with renal insufficiency, we used protein microarrays to measure serumantibodies from 17 patients with CKD and 7 control individu-als. We identified 38 proteins (measured on 42 spots of the10,112 spotted, or 0.4%) that demonstrated a significant in-crease in antibody binding levels as detected by secondaryantibody (Table I), and chose to validate four of these anti-gens: angiotensinogen (AGT), protein kinase R interactingprotein 1 (PRKRIP1), autophagy related 7 homolog (ATG7),and dual specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26). Anti-AGT antibodies demonstrated a significant increase from a mean intensity of 354 in control samples to a meanintensity of 891 in renal insufficiency samples (3.2 times in-crease, ttest pvalue/H110050.005; Fig. 1 A). As AGT is a well known drug target, and is known to be expressed in thekidney, as well as liver, lung, heart, and parts of the brain, AGTbecame our top candidate for validation. PRKRIP1 is alsoknown to be well expressed in kidney and is induced by IL11(21). IL11 can play a therapeutic role in reducing glomerular injury in mouse models of glomerulonephritis ( 22). Anti- PRKRIP1 antibodies showed a 2.2-fold increase, from 412 in control samples to 916 in renal insufficiency samples ( ttestp value/H110050.0007; Fig. 1 B). ATG7 showed a significant 4.7 fold increase, from a mean intensity of 155 in control samples to a mean intensity of 735in renal insufficiency samples ( ttest pvalue/H110050.00008; Fig. 1C). ATG7 knockout mice show abnormal liver and central nervous system physiology and function ( 23). Though ATG7 is known to play a role in autophagy, it had not been implicated in kidney disease. Finally, levels of anti-DUSP26 increasedfrom 278 in controls samples to 692 in renal insufficiencysamples (2.5-fold increase, ttest pvalue/H110050.007; Fig. 1 D). DUSP26 is involved in the growth of anaplastic thyroid cancercells ( 24), but its potential role in kidney function or disease has not been described to date. ELISAs were developed to detect serum immunoglobulin binding to these four candidate antigens, and were tested inindependent serum obtained from 50 patients with renal in-sufficiency and 21 healthy control individuals. A separatepublished study demonstrated that there is an excellent cor- relation in between the fluorescent signal detected by Pro-toarrays and signal intensity measured using ELISA ( 19). We confirmed that anti-AGT autoAb were significantly higher in CKD samples (mean 0.075, standard deviation 0.028) thancontrol samples (mean 0.021, standard deviation 0.022; 3.5times increase in level, ttest pvalue/H110050.00143; Fig. 2 A). Anti-AGT autoantibodies were able to distinguish CKD fromcontrol samples with an area under the receiver operating char-acteristic curve (area under the curve (AUC)) of 0.72 (Fig. 3). We also found anti-PRKRIP1 autoantibodies were signifi- cantly higher in CKD samples (mean 0.17, standard deviation0.09) than control samples (mean 0.13, standard deviation 0.05;Angiotensin Autoantibodies Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10.3 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497–3 1.3 times increase in level, ttest pvalue/H110050.0139; Fig. 2 B). Anti-AGT and anti-PRKRIP1 levels were themselves stronglycorrelated across all the samples with chronic renal injury (Pear-son correlation 0.47, pvalue 0.00056). Because of this, there was no meaningful improvement in the AUC when both anti-AGT and anti-PRKRIP1 measurements were combined usingcoefficients found through logistic regression (AUC 0.73). In the 50 independent samples for validation, from patients with CKD, there was no significant difference in anti-AGT andanti-PRKRIP1 antibodies by gender ( ttest pvalues 0.91 and 0.18, respectively), race (ANOVA pvalues 0.99 and 0.27, respectively), or by age (Pearson correlation pvalues 0.18 and 0.39, respectively). There was no significant difference in anti-AGT and anti-PRKRIP1 antibodies based on etiology of ESRD, when all 15 types of renal injury were considered(ANOVA pvalues 0.93 and 0.40, respectively), or when only those 38 samples from four major etiological categories wereconsidered (aplastic/hypoplastic/dysplastic kidneys; obstruc-tive uropathy; focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; and refluxnephropathy; pvalues 0.57 and 0.59, respectively). There was no significant difference in anti-AGT and anti-PRKRIP1 Abbased on whether dialysis was received in the pre-transplan-tation period ( ttest pvalues /H110050.97 and 0.71, respectively), nor whether a patient was on an anti-hypertensive therapy ( t test pvalues 0.74 and 0.24, respectively). Only two patients were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; there wasTABLE I We identified 38 proteins demonstrating an increase in serum antibody binding in patients with ESRD as compared with controls (see Methods).

Neither anti- body level significantly correlated with systolic or diastolicblood pressure at the time of transplant. These data indicatethat specific auto-Ab, mounted to AGT and PRKRIP1 are notlikely to be biased by gender, age, race, renal insufficiencytherapy, or original diagnosis, and relate instead to the com-mon causation of kidney injury in all patients. Our other two candidates for validation, anti-ATG7 and anti-DUSP26, did not show significant differences in levels inCKD samples compared with controls ( ttestpvalues /H110050.60 and 0.075, area under the ROC curves /H110050.50 and 0.63, respectively). DISCUSSION These results demonstrate the feasibility of using protein microarrays to discover serum auto-antibodies at increasedlevels in renal insufficiency from kidney injury. By comparingthe serum antibody profiles of patients with CKD versusFIG.1 .Four auto-autoantibodies were selected from 38 significant autoantibodies detected from serum samples using protein microarrays. White bars indicate levels detected in normal healthy control samples, whereas gray bars indicate samples from patients with end-stage renal disease of various etiologies, as indicated. Mean levels for each group are shown, along with ttest pvalues. A,anti- angiotensinogen (AGT). B,anti-protein kinase R interacting protein 1 (PRKRIP1). C, anti-autophagy related 7 homolog (ATG7). D, anti-dual specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26).Angiotensin Autoantibodies Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10.3 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497–5 healthy controls, we found and subsequently validated two auto-antibodies in CKD, a disease not normally considered asan autoimmune process: anti-AGT and anti-PRKRIP1. Unexpectedly, we found anti-angiotensinogen antibodies significantly higher in the serum of patients with chronic renalinjury. To our knowledge, neither auto-antibodies against AGTnor their association with morbidity have been previouslydescribed. Angiotensin itself is well known to play a role inkidney physiology and ESRD pathophysiology. Though mostsystemic angiotensinogen comes from the liver, angiotensino-gen is well known to also be expressed in the kidney ( 25). Angiotensinogen has been shown to be necessary for normal kidney development in mice as disruption of the angiotensino-gen gene leads to abnormal kidney vasculature, cortex, andtubules ( 26). AGT is converted to angiotensin I by renin, ex -pressed in the kidney, and subsequently converted to angio- tensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), expressedin the lungs and renal endothelium. As angiotensin II is apotent arteriolar vasoconstrictor, patients with hypertensionare commonly treated using ACE inhibitors. Several majorclinical trials have shown the benefit of angiotensin II receptorblockers in preventing nephropathy because of type 2 diabe-tes, possibly independent of effects on blood pressure ( 1, 27). Angiotensin II directly stimulates the transforming growth fac- tor /H9252pathway in kidney ( 28, 29), and is known to modulate tubulointerstitial fibrosis in animal models of chronic kidney disease ( 30). Interestingly, circulating levels of angiotensin II have been shown to be significantly higher in hemodialysis patients with hypotension compared with those with normalblood pressure ( 31), whereas others could not find a differ - ence in angiotensin II levels between control subjects anddiabetics with or without nephropathy ( 32). An analog to angiotensin I was successfully tested in rats nearly 10 years ago as an active immunization to prevent theincrease in blood pressure from angiotensin I ( 33), and clinical trials on an active immunization against angiotensin I and II are underway ( 34–36). Anti-angiotensin II receptor auto-anti - bodies have been described and associated with the devel-opment of pre-eclampsia ( 37, 38). Anti-PRKRIP1 is a novel auto-Ab for chronic renal injury. Although antibodies against other antigens, including strainsof bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes , have been shown to be increased in ESRD ( 39), to our knowledge, no auto-Ab have yet been described in chronic renal injury. There are several important limitations to consider in our study. This study is based on observational measurementsmade on a limited number of prevalent pretransplant patients.Measurements in additional samples may yield more positiveresults, especially for anti-DUSP26, which was negative in ourstudy but demonstrated a trend toward positivity. Althoughwe suspect the elevation of anti-angiotensinogen Ab are re- flective of kidney damage, we cannot exclude that theseauto-Ab are being raised because of increased amounts ofserum angiotensinogen or angiotensin I from decreased func-tioning of ACE, nor can we ascertain the specific pathogenic-ity of these auto-Ab. Although we cannot ascertain where thepotential antigens may be coming from, it does appear likelythat both PRKRIP1 and AGT antigens are present in the organundergoing damage. We cannot distinguish whether theseauto-Ab are targeting angiotensinogen or angiotensin I, ascross-reactivity in antibodies against these two antigens hasbeen described ( 33). A more detailed study is warranted to establish an antibody assay to test whether these antibodies target the full length protein or a specific fragment or epitope ofthe protein. In this pilot study, anti-AGT demonstrated a sensi-tivity of 70% at a specificity of 70%. Improvements in theseassays, including further delineation of the reactive peptides,are still needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity toabove 90%, where performance reaches clinical levels ( 40).FIG.2 .Serum ELISAs successfully validated two of four tested autoantibodies in patients with end-stage renal disease. Mean and one standard deviation are shown. A, anti-angiotensinogen (AGT). B, anti-protein kinase R interacting protein 1 (PRKRIP1). FIG.3 .Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showing the performance of anti-AGT (black) and anti-PRKRIP1 (gray)auto antibodies in distinguishing samples from patients withESRD from control samples. Areas under the ROC curves are 0.72 and 0.62, respectively.Angiotensin Autoantibodies 10.1074/mcp.M110.000497–6 Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 10.3 We also acknowledge that in this pilot study, we may not have enough samples to associate anti-AGT with differencesin blood pressure or renal injury course, or to fully compen-sate for multiple hypothesis testing. A significant challengewith protein microarray measurements is that methodologiesfor correcting for multiple hypothesis testing have not yetbeen fully established; we feel this is less of a concern here,because of the validation phase we added to this study. Wealso acknowledge that the average spot-to-spot correlation ofintensity measurements on the protein arrays may have beena contributing factor to our success rate in validation. As usedhere, auto-Ab levels measured for diagnostic purposes fornon-autoimmune disease are likely to demonstrate lower in-tensities than auto-Ab levels traditionally measured in auto-immune diseases, so continued improvements in the reliabilityof measurements at these lower levels will clearly be needed. Nonetheless, it is interesting that patients with CKD have a common auto-Ab response, regardless of the original causeof their chronic renal insufficiency. Auto-immune responses totissue damage and disease may be more prevalent acrossdiseases than is otherwise considered today. Future studies arestill needed to ascertain whether these results are reproduced inlarger patient cohorts, how early these auto-Ab are present andcan be detected, whether there is a clinical distinction in pa-tients with varying levels of these auto-Ab, and whether theyplay a role in therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors. These twospecific auto-Ab need to be tested in serially in patients withoccult or early renal insufficiency to distinguish those few whoprogress to CKD and ESRD. Finally, as more biomarkers arebeing sought for other chronic conditions, the detection ofauto-immune responses to changes in proteins may be easierto detect than changes in the proteins themselves. Our results highlight that even in organ injuries from non- immune causes; there is a significant component of inflam-matory and auto-immune signal that generates a repertoire ofauto-immune Ab that track exquisitely with the presence orabsence of underlying end-organ injury. Uncovering the rep-ertoire of these novel auto-Ab to specific antigenic targets,can serve as detectable and effective biomarkers of specificend-organ injury. Future work will involve more extensiveantibody-antigen titration for each potential biomarker re- ported, which is beyond the scope of the focused nature ofthis pilot study. Further studies are also needed to test andvalidate if prospective screening for these auto-Ab can pro-vide non-invasive surrogates for detection and progression ofCKD. Early detection of organ injury carries a significant socialand economic impact for improved therapeutic interventionswith resultant improved patient morbidity and mortality.
